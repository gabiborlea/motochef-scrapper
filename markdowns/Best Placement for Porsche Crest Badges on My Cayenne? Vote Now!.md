UPDATE> DECISION MADE -- Not applying the badge, have returned it.
  1. ===========

Folks, I'm looking to add a subtle visual enhancement to my 9Y0.2 Cayenne. I recently purchased three high-quality metal badges featuring the Porsche Crest. They have a premium feel and finish. According to the manufacturer: Our metal emblems are made from high quality steel. The domed stickers are coated with a scratch-proof polyurethane epoxy resin. The plastic coating is not only scratch-proof, but it also protects the sticker from the sun's harmful UV rays. This protection helps your logo looking bright and fade-free, preserving the colors quality. We use a high resolution 4 colour (CMYK) process to print all logos, text and background into our products. I’d love to get your input—what's the best placement for these badges? ​​​  ![](https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/500x500/porsche_crest_metal_badge_48a76d23d0c038b459a7b259220e725ad4e8669d.png) ![](https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1920x1080/badge_on_trunk_lid_c7b750725abc6a521c8f18cf1af80039de6ec3c7.png) ![](https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x823/badge_on_fender_7ef2b34b67e8adc9c0a887901a8a684587eed90c.png) ![](https://cimg4.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x823/badge_on_c_pillar_b49b348fc6f7ef859e12f660cabf12e001a64252.png) ![](https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x478/nobadges_25f2500f38e3f812f5068bd4c5ec866ed0e55b9c.png)

please don’t put those on!!! Looks cleaner without it on!! You’re going to hate life and possible damage your beautiful paint when you go to remove them in the future.

it is interesting the strong reaction people are having w these badges. a friend of mine and I looked at an orca colored alfa romeo giulia quadrifoglio - and the vehicle had a unique color combo and badging that many may say was awful, i thought it was kind of cool:  ![](https://cimg5.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1835_a82717c2f1d4ab1507657b3df850265b7fe37141.jpg) ![](https://cimg7.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1836_99886bf4fae33a5b7348b3e0033c98bf659b581d.jpg) ![](https://cimg9.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1837_ba34bd6fd942c7b521058dfbd53e9604aa5733f7.jpg) ![](https://cimg1.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1839_467c0da68cef2610cce020f8e038feb49fe1dc1d.jpg) ![](https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1840_04c7d65e2948af41a357a6a7ae7a55e60fd075ca.jpg)

I'm also not a fan of them (or any badges / etc.). I had the 'PORSCHE' on the sides removed from my Cayenne and also had it debadged.

Our Cayenne has the factory badges but nothing “extra”, and we tend to lean toward de-badging. We did not spec any additional badges like on the doors. I removed the rear badge from my 718 GT4, and in the past we’ve removed the “PORSCHE” and model badge from a variety of cars. Our 992 was de-badged. With that said, please do what YOU love. Who cares what other people think? It’s your money and only your opinion matters. And with badges you can change your mind and remove them. If they are adhered with the spongy double-sided sticky “pads” (like 3M), they usually are easily removed with a bit of heat from a hand-held hair dryer, and some dental floss. I’d be surprised if paint is damaged when you remove the badge, unless the paint is newer or not in sound condition before the badge is installed. Whatever your decision, enjoy your Cayenne.

it is interesting the strong reaction people are having w these badges. a friend of mine and I looked at an orca colored alfa romeo giulia quadrifoglio - and the vehicle had a unique color combo and badging that many may say was awful, i thought it was kind of cool:
Thomas, that's a different story. The four-leaf clover is the traditional and exclusive Quadrifolglio factory designation of these Alfa Romeo models. Traditional OEM designation is one thing, and an aftermarket, free impression of the Porsche crest is another.

Wow! That’s a strong no from the community—I ended up returning it. I’ve been itching to do something on my car! So far, I’ve had tints applied all around, including the windshield. This is actually the first windshield tint I’ve had where I can see the HUD with my polarized glasses on. I tried 3M Crystalline and Llumar Stratos before, but neither worked. Super happy with the outcome this time! The itch is still there, though! But cosmetically, I’m keeping the car untouched. Next up, I’m getting a 2-channel front and rear dashcam installed, and then I’ll hold off for a bit. Waiting for Cobb to release something for the 2024s—once they do, that’ll be my next mod!

Does anyone know how to close a poll? I can't seem to figure it out. Normally, I'd expect the option to appear when editing the original post, but it's not showing up. Any help would be appreciated!

[@MSCA](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/339670-msca.html>) ideas for you: there are the porsche body decals. you can do things that cost a lot and are subtle, like titanium lug bolts. nice 2nd set of vossen forged wheels. porsche carbon fiber mirror caps (i know some don’t like carbon fiber). new porsche steering wheel is another way to personalize.

[@MSCA](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/339670-msca.html>) ideas for you: there are the porsche body decals. you can do things that cost a lot and are subtle, like titanium lug bolts. nice 2nd set of vossen forged wheels. porsche carbon fiber mirror caps (i know some don’t like carbon fiber). new porsche steering wheel is another way to personalize.
Thanks, [@ThomasWShea](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/309893-thomaswshea.html>) Those mods are great suggestions but as I purchased the car in Nov 2024, I don't want to replace anything existing yet...instead want to enjoy it for a bit.
