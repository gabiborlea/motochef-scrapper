Options: 1. Don’t worry about it. Bring it to the attention of the next place you have the oil changed. 2. Bring it back to the dealer and tell them to do the oil change again with the correct oil, at no charge to you. I would choose #1.

Porsche says C20 is supposed to be C20 with a viscosity of 0W20. The 0W40 in the C40 specification is for V8 engines. Ask your dealer to change the oil to the correct one at their expense.

Porsche says C20 is supposed to be C20 with a viscosity of 0W20. The 0W40 in the C40 specification is for V8 engines. Ask your dealer to change the oil to the correct one at their expense.
These engines have electrically controlled vane cell oil pump. If you use a thicker oil, then the pump will reduce flow to maintain a specific ECU mapped oi pressure via the sender. This has the effect of reducing the ability of the oil remove heat from lubricated engine parts and transfer that heat to the oil cooler. Thinner oil has the same mass per liter as thicker oil, so then you slow down the oil velocity through the cooler, less heat is conducted from the oil to the water cooling circuit. There are modes where the oil cooler is bypassed, such as startup and low power demand, to save pumping losses. So you have to balance thicker oil's shear strength against oil flow pressure-velocity relationships .

I'm wondering, is it ok for engine to run 0w40? I'm don't have much interest to change it again if it is ok
You have a new car still under warranty so don't experiment with oil. Your Cayenne's engine and its accessories are designed for 0W20 oil. So once again my advice: get the oil changed to the right one.

Assuming you go back, ask the dealer if it actually makes any difference. I think many here don’t know much other than what they read in the owner’s manual. No, the VW 3.0L was not designed around C20 0W20 oil, but the C part of the oil spec is apparently intended to work better with OPF if your car has them and may be helpful in reducing the likelihood of LSPI. My car does not have OPF, but the anti LSPI properties of a C oil is appealing. As for 0W20 or 0W30 or 0W40 within the C spec, I am not convinced it matters except for fuel economy.

There’s no question to change the oil. At full engine temperature, 20 weight oil is half the thickness of 40 weight oil. While some of the rationale for 20 is for fuel economy, it is also due to tighter tolerances. You should always stick with manufacturer specs.

Here’s one good reason: Because people falsely believe that by servicing their cars at stealerships and grossly overpaying results in competent expertise. That is often not the case.

Humans are not infallible. I seem to recall that when I last checked, the technicians at Porsche dealerships were human beings. So possibly paying less at an independent shop guarantees that you won't experience a mishap? This type of thing can and does happen everywhere. OP - I concur with those that advised taking the car back to the shop and have them redo the oil change.

These engines have electrically controlled vane cell oil pump.
The electrically controlled valve is a candidate for disconnection, same idea as disconnecting vacuum from water pump and coolant shutoff valve. The MB crowd is deactivating oil pressure control solenoids so that maximum oil pressure is delivered 100% of the time. Fundamental reason is to increase engine longevity.
