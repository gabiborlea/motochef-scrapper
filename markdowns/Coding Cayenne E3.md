I'd like to start a thread 9YA coding. At the time of this, PIWIS 3 is required, original or clone. Proceed at your own risk. you can easily brick one or more modules. This is for research only and the car should not be driven at all, nowhere. Not even started. Results will vary. Professional driver on closed course etc. I'm just starting, the literature on the subject is minimal, but beemers were like that at a point. Plug in an external battery maintainer. Be careful with that. PlplaWith the PIWIS in engineer mode, connect the car, turn on the ignition. Diagnostics-F7 (additional menu)- maintenance data- press next until the list of options populate in German. find the entries for what you want to change. For example, two entries for headlights, choose PLDS+ incl Matrix. - Save (F8). Go back to the initial menu. Choose all modules- programming- automatic programming. Wait and freak out about the lights and sounds. Read and delete errors. This is still not tested for full functionality- edit to be added here. Under F7 there's an option for start stop. One can change it to without (ohne) and live free from that, but that's not good for the environment. Baby steps. All takes time and patience here. Code more than one thing and you may find yourself sorting for what went wrong, in German. Tal lots of pictures of the chosen modules so you can backtrack. Google translate is your friend. It can take some time and voltage fluctuation is your enemy. Find a hefty maintainer. Porsche recommends 90A. I went with 75A. Some use 55A. Check the drain versus your home fuse box. Let's post experiences here. I know there's a lot of options under coding for several modules, but once connected to the car I could not access (manual coding without rules). In there lies a lot of options. We should be able to code (for research purposes only), raise and low windows with key fob , close rear deck with key fob, possibly android car (it's there, I've seen it), individualize the dashboard and PCM screens. Well, good luck to all. I hope this thread helps all of us on this.

Thanks John. I assume your instructions will make more sense when staring at the actual PIWIS 3 screen. BTW what battery maintainer are you using during programming on your Cayenne lithium battery? 55A is up there!

I went with this one: [https://www.batterystuff.com/power-s...pmbc-75lk.html](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/www.batterystuff.com/power-supplies/load-bearing-chargers/powermax-12v-75-amp-pmbc-series-charger-converter-power-supply-with-alligator-clamps-pmbc-75lk.html>) Yes, it will make more sense once you have the PIWIS up and running. I tried experimenting without connecting to the car, just to see what's there. It's a lot. Unfortunately I'm yet to figure how to activate that part of coding (programming option) using manual coding. Android auto, garage pilot, advanced screen menus, deck lid operation, traffic sign recognition, to name a few. On the 992 GT3 there's a yellow/blue shift light, that I'd like to see it working on my 992. Also on that car, the TPMS is on the left, which is helpful on track days. I don't think a lot of hardware differences exist as it's cheaper to build on thing and just write different softwares.

There's a lot of "remember last setting" options when coding module per module. I can see those when I navigate the coding menus without being connected to the car. For instance, seat heating/ventilation, a/c temp, steering wheel heat, sport mode, ***, numerous disclaimers etc. when I connect to the car those menus don't appear to me. I'm missing a step for sure. I searched but there's very little in the internet's regarding the modules. What works now is finding the car options on the additional menu, change them and automatically code all the modules. On the cayenne, there's the obvious 8G4 that is LED including matrix and turn off ***. There's a setting fo DDL for different world markets. I'd imagine one of them would mean manual control override. I did not try it, as every time you code there's a risk, at least without a shop manual. There must be a way to code module per module as mentioned above, for more detailed tailored options. I'll post if I find something. If anyone was successful, please share...

Managed to do a couple of things. Going slowly to avoid mishaps. Increase time between pressing the trunk lid close button and it start moving. Useful on tight spaces. Close lid with remote control is next. Allowed for keyboard and all music availability on CarPlay. Shut off some of the disclaimers. Left the legally required warnings. Found where the *** strategy is written. They have preset programs. It may only mean when and why it comes to action or if it remembers the last setting. Needs testing. All the read and writing takes time. If you do too much at once and something goes wrong, it can be a pain to undo everything. So, baby steps. Interesting that I found Cayenne GT in the list of models. GTS was there too, so that makes you wonder what's the deal with that.

My cayenne doesn't have ACC, but I don't think it matters for LKA or lane change assist as they use the windshield camera. The radar uses fir the detection of cars (blind spot) uses the parking sensors if I'm not mistaken. The active steering function may require some specific hardware. I'm going to try that on my 992 that has ACC and active steering. In all likelihood there may be a missing or different module.

Couple of things done. Airbag activate/deactivate disclaimer is gone. Added sport chrono (Laptimer) for the right screen menu. allowed for keyboard and full music access with CarPlay in motion. Added off-road and sport chrono to the HUD. Activated expert menu. I'm almost certain that one can customize what on which screen to have info. Eg, navigation map on the left, car info on the right and so on. It seems all the fields are vastly customizable. Android auto is there. Not sure if added hardware would be required.

I hope you are taking good notes John. What would be EXTREMELY helpful is a complete walkthrough. Especially since you say the menus are largely in German. ie. You should do one thing at a time. You must first connect and enter engineering mode, then make one change, then save. To make multiple changes, go through that entire process multiple times. To connect to the car and get into engineering mode, do the following... Then you should choose one and only one of the following changes... If you want to do X, then do the following... hit A then hit B then choose C If you want to change Y, do the following... etc. After each change, hit “gesaven” and test. That kind of step by step instructions would be incredibly useful. I know I would love to have that type of reference if it is something you are able and willing to pull together. Big thanks for being the pioneer on this. It has been great to watch your progress. thanks!

You must first connect and enter engineering mode, then make one change, then save. To make multiple changes, go through that entire process multiple times. To connect to the car and get into engineering mode, do the following... Then you should choose one and only one of the following changes... If you want to do X, then do the following... hit A then hit B then choose C If you want to change Y, do the following... etc. After each change, hit “gesaven” and test. That kind of step by step instructions would be incredibly useful. I know I would love to have that type of reference of it is something you are able and willing to pull together. thanks!
I'm taking pictures before saving any changes, in case I get error messages. No more than 3 changes at a time. Several were ineffective. Some left a blank screen on the dashboard menus (traffic sign recognition-to me coded). Once I hook up to a desktop it will be easier to show where things are on such pictures. They have the module so it's easy to find and make changes. Like the pic attached, which is for demonstration purposes only, I would never fiddle with the great ***

Couple of things done. Airbag activate/deactivate disclaimer is gone. Added sport chrono (Laptimer) for the right screen menu. allowed for keyboard and full music access with CarPlay in motion. Added off-road and sport chrono to the HUD. Activated expert menu. I'm almost certain that one can customize what on which screen to have info. Eg, navigation map on the left, car info on the right and so on. It seems all the fields are vastly customizable. Android auto is there. Not sure if added hardware would be required.
can you please check if you can activate Active Lane keep ? Thanks 🙏

That needs activation in a different menu, where the car options are written. I'm quite sure it's there. After I take the car to the shop for an unrelated issue, I'll try it. I don't want them to see modules changing before warranty service.
