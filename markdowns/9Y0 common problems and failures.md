Transfer case = wet multi plate clutch. We agree. There is no definitive root cause, we agree. Transmission mount replacement is not the problem or the solution, we agree. The problem is believed to be rooted in the wet multi-plate clutch device.

Thanks for clarifying! I was not aware the wet multi-plate clutch device is (or is in) the transfer case. Would you be able to edit your original post to make this clear for others who, like me, are not as deeply steeped in the inner workings and parts nomenclature of the car? It would help those of us, seeing your post, in explaining to a dealer what may be the cause of and possible fix for the vibration problem.

Same question here! Was looking to buy 2023 Cayenne Turbo but wanted to do some research before I pull the trigger

No official confirmation that the 6th gear vibration/shudder has been solved by Porsche. There are fewer complains 2022 and later. Same with lurching/surging, late .1 seem to have fewer reports of it. PSCB brakes are discontinued to my knowledge. LiFePO4 batteries are discontinued since late .1. No change on oil vapor separator or water pump updates.

I have a 2022. I can say for certain the 6th gear vibration is NOT fixed. It is very noticeable in my car. However, the lurching/surging issue IS fixed. Shifting is very smooth.

42,000 miles on our 2022 GTS, never had this 6th gear issue. I’m probably lucky.

I have a 2022. I can say for certain the 6th gear vibration is NOT fixed. It is very noticeable in my car. However, the lurching/surging issue IS fixed. Shifting is very smooth.
What model trim do you have?
