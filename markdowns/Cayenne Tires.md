I think I already know the answer to the question, but is there any wheel/tire insurance offing available to purchase after you've already owned the car? If not, where does everyone get their tires replaced at?

I buy mine on Tire Rack and have them shipped to my local independent shop specializing in German cars. They know how to mount large, low-profile tires and use proper torque wrenches on expensive wheels.

I bought mine as CPO and use Sonsio for my tire and wheel coverage. They are good to work with. Sonsio.com

For anyone curious, AAA offers a good tire and wheel protection package along with key fob replacement and small dent repair. Its ~1200 for 4 years and you can take it out anytime with a 30 day/1000 mile waiting period. Very niche question but I know Porsche dealers do not plug tires. So if you have the tire insurance and have something that can be plugged, will Porsche dealer simply refuse to do the work or will insurance cover the replacement? Can you "force" insurance to cover since the plus is not acceptable per the manufacturer?

'23 CGTS wheel/tire policy at purchase (SW Fla) is no questions, any damage gets new tire. Wheel/Tire insurance has paid for itself every purchase - 2010 Touareg, 2014 CTS-V Wagon (many times over), 2017 Cayenne Plat and 2023 Cayenne GTS with 22' summers. Roads decent, construction debris not.

The Porsche plan is replacement only. If you have it plugged by a 3rd party and it fails I think Porsche would look at this as an exclusion: Repairs made without prior authorization from the Porsche Protection Plan Administrator. You would have to look into the terms and conditions of the 3rd party plan but I would suspect they would only allow approved repairs.

Does anybody have any concerns about Continental Procontact TX tires? I'm looking for good all-season tires, mostly dirving in SoCal weather, where we occasionally get heavy rain and mostly summer.

those were the OE tire on my audi Q3. i drove them for 50,000 miles. i got a new set at some point, maybe around 36 thousand miles? i don’t recall. they were fine. it is an all season, so they aren’t going to amaze. people on here really like the tires you have quite a bit.

Yes my local Costco can only source PS4s and it will take 2-5 business days. They don’t do Continentals or Pirelli. Planning to go in and see if it can be patched up and get few more K miles out of this set.

Does anybody have any concerns about Continental Procontact TX tires? I'm looking for good all-season tires, mostly dirving in SoCal weather, where we occasionally get heavy rain and mostly summer. My base Cayenne w/o PASM, came with a set of Pirellis Scorpion Verdes A/S tires in 21" Spyder wheels. Right around finishing 17K miles a nail punctured through the sidewall. I could already start to see the mid bar indicators, so might as well change all 4 at once. I was expecting this set to last longer, given that it's never pushed hard. I love Michelin PS4s, and that's the only tire I put in my M4, but for a SUV I would like to go with a set of all seasons since it's our daily.
I'm happy with the N-spec, Continental ProContacts on our GTS. They are good in both hot and cold, excellent in heavy rain, and did a good job in a recent 9" snowstorm. We don't drive the Cayenne GTS the way I'd normally drive a sports car. That's what our Turbo S and Corvette are for, and I just don't get running summer tires on an SUV. Our GTS came standard with the N-spec Pirelli summers for Cayenne, and I don't notice any significant loss of handling performance in the switch to the Contis, in sane, spirited, street driving. I'm sure if I really pushed it hard in hot temps I would. I do have a lot of track time, and I am sensitive to tire performance.
