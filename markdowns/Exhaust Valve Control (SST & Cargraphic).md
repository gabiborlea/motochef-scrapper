![Default](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/icons/icon1.gif) **Exhaust Valve Control (SST & Cargraphic)**
Hi everyone, Since I got my 2021 Cayenne GTS I wasn't 100% satisfied with the exhaust sound except the cold start which only last for couple of seconds. I'm not planning to install any aftermarket parts except for a valve controller unit (SST or Cargraphic controllers). I would like to know how the sound is compared to the cold start with PSE on. I also were searching for Cargraphic valve controller on Supremepower website but it seems like if it was removed from there or it's not longer available. Thanks,

do the exhaust valve controllers work for the .2 as well? is there no controller on market that fully opens valves in sport/sport + mode instead of having to use a remote?

Hey supreme power, I also saw the cargraphics velve controller available from their website for the 2022 Ceyenne e hybrid, I wonder do you have this in stock? [https://www.cargraphic.de/en/your-ve...exflaprcoee3e/](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/www.cargraphic.de/en/your-vehicle/for-porsche/for-cayenne/e3/cargraphic-tuning-program-for-porsche-cayenne-e-hybrid-30l-v6-e3-9ya/cargraphic-sport-exhaust-systems-for-porsche-cayenne-e-hybrid-30l-v6-e3-9ya/valve-control-unit-for-porsche-e3-cayenne-e-hybrid-30l-v6-mono-turbo-single-flow/exflaprcoee3e/>) It looks very similar to the one I installed on my 992 GTS.

Yes I would be very interested also if this would plug n play for a 2024 Cayenne e hybrid S coupe. Watching closely.

Yes I would be very interested also if this would plug n play for a 2024 Cayenne e hybrid S coupe. Watching closely.
I already have a email out to to Cargraphic to find out for you guys, I’ll let you know

I installed my SST unit over the weekend. 2019 Cayenne S, standard (non-PSE) exhaust. I posted to the other thread, but I guess I will use this one going forward. First things first. There was a bit of misinformation on the other thread about non-PSE exhaust having valves. Some say one valve, some say two, some say none. Well I crawled underneath and looked for valves and I swore I saw two valves. I went ahead and ordered the controller from Extreme Power House. Turns out I am an idiot and there is actually only a valve on the passenger side. I must have saw the hanger hardware on the driver's side and thought it was the valve bracket. Since I was under there and had everything ready to go, I went ahead and installed the controller anyway. I can say that you can hear a difference, outside the car, with the valve forced open but to me it is not a $300 difference. Inside the car you cannot tell at all. I am sure I will be able to use the valve kit some day on a future Porsche so I guess I will keep it, but for now it is a total waste of money for non-PSE exhaust. I am curious how this would sound on a PSE muffler. I am thinking it might be worth the money to keep the PSE open all the time, but even the PSE is still pretty quiet. I am now thinking about sourcing a PSE muffler.

This is how standard exhaust looks. One valve.  ![](https://cimg9.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1220x2000/6b546c99_0470_4035_babf_e0a8d797071e_1_201_a_fe35f76e74b6671b182e54b4b20e2ae58a7f0c52.jpeg)

I will have to somewhat retract my last post. After getting it out on the road for a bit more driving I can say that there is a subtle difference in exhaust tone with the valves always open. Especially during full throttle shifts. There is a much more pronounced burp when changing gears. I don't expect to drive like that very often, so this has little value to me but it is there. So going back to is it worth it to use a controller on a base exhaust... I would say maybe. Let's put it this way, I am not going to remove it. Actually I may take it off when I bring it to the dealer for my 6th gear shudder issue, but otherwise I will leave it be. I have a line on a cheap dual valved exhaust supposedly from a Turbo which could be grafted in (the mid pipes were cut off for salvage). Anybody know if there are any differences in the rear mufflers other than the number of valves? Is a PSE rear muffler internally different from a standard muffler?

Here is a PSE exhaust. Apart 2 separate tail pipes with valves looks the same as standard.  ![](https://cimg4.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1340x2000/6e5e2853_5b9d_4a5d_a0b6_31d555752caf_1_201_a_42a7d7fa0f7d0f885f4d414a15c7e09f845c815b.jpeg)

Yes, Agreed it looks pretty much the same. I also just realized, however, that just grafting in a twin-valved sport-exhaust muffler is not really going to work without the second valve controller from the car itself. I was hoping for a simple muffler swap and this SST controller would do the trick, but it is starting to look more involved. Maybe a custom Y-splitter for the single valve controller pigtail to feed both valves on the donor muffler? I wonder if cars with PSE actuate the two flaps independent of one another? Would it even matter? Could be looking at an OEM-ish PSE upgrade for less than $1000.

The link you provided is for Macan. They have a similar product for Cayenne which appears to be a universal fit. Good find if you want always open all the time. EDIT: actually this wouldn't solve the problem. This product shunts the pigtail from the car to prevent codes from being thrown by simply unplugging it from the valve actuator. My problem is there is no second pigtail for the stock exhaust equipped cars like mine with just one valve. Thinking it through, if this item even exists, then I guess I wouldn't even need to plug anything into the second valve. It would simply stay open. Also, I see that the Hybrid is not listed as compatible so, no it isn't universal and yeah it may not work on your car it if is 3-pin.
