You can remove the entire door sill trim. This is the one that the car logo trims are glued to. It is held on with clips.  ![](https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x741/e1e8c8f9_37d0_4262_9c95_78b895b63d12_1_201_a_61356acc57d13776debb6b6572e3b41b4f131565.jpeg)

The parts guy advised me that the wiring should be there regardless I have that option or not. I am not able to check it since the door sills are glued, not clipped. Anyone have any experience ?

I don't know. If you don't have wires you can always pull the cables from the puddle lights that are in the doors. It's not particularly difficult. But first, tilt the door sill trim at the front or back (you don't have to remove it completely) and see. Because in one car there may be a connection and in another there isn't.

I've tried finding illuminated sills for my 2019 Turbo, but have been told they're not available (as in, weren't offered). Do you have a source for them?

Thanks, will do. Sorry if it seemed I was hijacking the thread. To the OP's topic, I don't know whether the 2019+ Cayennes have the wiring harness already in place. I know that, for my 2008 Cayenne GTS, I added the illuminated sills, and the kit from Porsche came with the necessary wiring.

Thanks, will do. Sorry if it seemed I was hijacking the thread. To the OP's topic, I don't know whether the 2019+ Cayennes have the wiring harness already in place. I know that, for my 2008 Cayenne GTS, I added the illuminated sills, and the kit from Porsche came with the necessary wiring.
In older models, illuminated door sills were sold as accessories by Porsche Tequipement. In newer models, they are not available as accessories and can only be purchased as a spare part.

I purchased the carbon fiber door sills for my Turbo. I will keep you updated if the wiring is ready or not when they arrive. Thanks
