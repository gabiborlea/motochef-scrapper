Team, well this came together quickly, attached is my build - any last minute recommendation/changes? Found an allocation unsold with a lock date of Tuesday. Help me make sure I didn't miss anything in my speed of movement.

That’ll be sweet! Nice job. 2 thoughts, and it’s possible that these items are std in ‘25, part of another option pkg, or just not a priority to you: 1. Some kind of extended leather pkg? I love my leather dash & upper doors with contrast stitching. 2. I’ve got 14-way seats in my ‘20 turbo, but the 18-way seats in my wife’s A6 are even nicer. If I was specing a new ride, I’d probably opt for 18-way. Good luck. I’d be so excited to be waiting for that baby to arrive!

Add soft close doors. And 18-way seats if your body size/shape tolerates them. Air susp = standard on Turbo eH correct?

Soft close doors. I don’t see Roof Rails in gloss black - cannot be added after manufacturing. With the solid black interior, I’d add deviated stitching in Chalk to tie in the exterior.

Would add Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control. No body roll, better ride and handling.

Soft close doors.
Those are standard for 2025. It was optional for 24 models.

Appreciate how fast everyone replied - thank you. 1. I think the turbo has quite a bit of leather, there we very few add-on leather options, since most of it is standard 2. 18 way seats are standard on the turbo, hence not seeing it on the build sheet 3. Soft close doors standard 4. Air suspension standard 5. PDCC, I'll get that on my 911 6. Roof rails, I'll never use them, and I think it looks better without. I'm thinking it won't be an issue at resale, isn't going to prevent someone from buying. But if you all think I'm totally wrong, tell me now!

5. PDCC, I'll get that on my 911
I will be honest if I was going for a Turbo I would PDCC for the handling. I have it on my base ehybrid my24 and I tried another without PDCC (nearly identical spec and build date) and it was better with PDCC although on base its not a killer thing but on Turbo it would be very welcome I imagine. Driving the same route with the 2 base ones I noticed the car had a far bit more roll without it although the roll wasnt bad bad, its still a porsche with air suspension but it was noticeable and that wasnt driving too hard as well.

Appreciate how fast everyone replied - thank you. 1. I think the turbo has quite a bit of leather, there we very few add-on leather options, since most of it is standard 2. 18 way seats are standard on the turbo, hence not seeing it on the build sheet 3. Soft close doors standard 4. Air suspension standard 5. PDCC, I'll get that on my 911 6. Roof rails, I'll never use them, and I think it looks better without. I'm thinking it won't be an issue at resale, isn't going to prevent someone from buying. But if you all think I'm totally wrong, tell me now!
I would suggest getting the roof rails. If you do and then decide to opt for roof-mounted carrier, it will be a cleaner / easier connection for the OEM roof rack bars. Even if you don't plan on using such a system, the next owner of the vehicle might want that. I had a 2019 Cayenne without the roof rails and found that I wished the vehicle had them. Plus, subjectively, I think the car looks better with them. Roof Rack Bars shown below connected to the Cayenne roof rails: <https://www.suncoastparts.com/product/SKU9Y0RTS.html>

I would add leather grab handles - this will give you the exposed stitches that match what is on the armrest. without this option, the grab handles are still leather, but there is just a center seam, instead of exposed stitching matching the armrest. it's nicer if they match.

Good call outs - I added to the build, and got it snuck in right before the cutoff. Thanks team!

That's an awesome spec! I’d tweak a few things, but it's all subjective—everyone has their own preferences. Do what you prefer and love… in any case, you’d have a blast with that car! Here’s what I’d go with: **ADD:**
  1. PDCC – significantly enhances stability on curvy roads, a must for driving a Turbo hard.
  2. Door Sill Guards in Black Brushed Aluminum (illuminated) – adds a premium touch.
  3. Exclusive Design Sport Wheels in Turbonite – complements the Turbo badge and enhances the Turbonite theme.
  4. Sport Chrono Package with Porsche Design Subsecond clock – essential for performance and aesthetics.
  5. Seat belts in Chalk – adds a subtle contrast to the interior.
  6. Air Quality System – improves interior air filtration.
  7. Preparation for Porsche dash cam – a $140 option that could add value for resale.
  8. Delivery experience in Atlanta or LA – a great way to take delivery.
  9. Remote Park Assist – useful for tight parking situations and adds a cool factor.
  10. Fire extinguisher – a $140 option that adds a unique touch.
  11. Exterior mirrors in high-gloss black ($0 option).
  12. Door handles in high-gloss black (both items (mirror and door handles) on the door would be black to keep the theme intact

**REMOVE:**
  1. Power Sunshades – they tend to catch dirt over time. You'll probably get tints for the heat reflection.
  2. Roof Rails – ABSOLUTELY NOT ADD...this visually increases the Cayenne’s height and makes its center of gravity look higher. This is against what we want in terms of looks. Folks who buy Turbos aren't looking for utilitarian vehicles, plus as you said you have never used it yourself. DON'T add it.
  3. High-gloss black window trim – the Turbonite theme looks much better and matches the Turbo badge.
  4. HD Matrix Headlights in Black – the standard version keeps the Turbonite aesthetic more cohesive.
  5. Burmester audio – Bose is the better value option and is pretty good in the Cayenne.

With these changes, the MSRP should increase by less than $1K (if I am seeing it correctly). Good luck!!

It goes well with the puddle light, actually. Mine was actually the first time I saw it in person.  ![](https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1500x2000/pxl_20250204_190504332_5d4a5c82d8f9b2d329451467fe23e2a7c6787027.jpg)
