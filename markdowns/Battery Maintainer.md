I don’t drive much, so I leave my Cayenne connected to a CTEK Lithium – US. For those who don’t drive much, what do you do?  ![](https://cimg6.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_7741_14053d5a5c5db972a6783959cf7b89b525e3faf4.jpeg)

That’s a good practice, Poppyboy. I do the same. Ever since I converted my battery to AGM, I switched out my CTEK Lithium for a NOCO Genius 10, which has programs for both Lithium and AGM. However, I just received a new toy; my [@Antigravity](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/199522-antigravity.html>) SC-10 Super Charger on which I am conducting an evaluation. It has a handy display that is much more useful than the lights on the CTEK and NOCO.

is the Antigravity charger also a maintainer? We have always used Battery Tender for our cars and motorcycles, boats and even construction equipment. It maintains the charge and charges as needed. Been very pleased with this product

Yes, once charged, it is also a maintainer. I use a variety of different chargers / maintainers for my vehicles — a mix of Battery Tenders, CTEK’s, and NOCO’s. This Antigravity is my favorite so far. (Although I’ve only been using it a couple days now and haven’t finished putting it through all my testing). Testing ongoing.

Yes this is a "smart" charger similar to NOCO/CTEK but with a little more useful information such as battery percentage, charging information, state of charge. I am interested in anti-gravity as well. Looking forward to schnave's feedback.

Do they use standard SAE connections or proprietary? What is the length of the charging cable and wire gauge? I have to reach about 12ft from my 20A receptacle. I can't get extension for my NOCO G15000 without using some elaborate ridiculous conversion, an X-connect adapter and some SAE extensions, SAE clamps.

Do they use standard SAE connections or proprietary? What is the length of the charging cable and wire gauge? I have to reach about 12ft from my 20A receptacle. I can't get extension for my NOCO G15000 without using some elaborate ridiculous conversion, an X-connect adapter and some SAE extensions, SAE clamps.
We do have SAE connnectors and it was quite intentional because I learned many, many years ago that proprietary plugs are super annoying. I like standardized plugs for ease of use and replacement, and I wasn't going to have Chargers that required special connectors to try to keep Customer only buying our connector for something as simple as charging. A Charger should be a standardized connector type of product, just like the Type C connector is now for Phones and I'm glad the government made Apple change to a TYPE C USB instead of the silly special plugs that were not standardized and I always couldn't find. **The Super-Charger has an attached power cable (6ft) and SAE cable (5ft), but please note that the reason for these length are actually based on being able to provide the current and voltage we state it does. For example if you get a longer SAE cable for the clamps... say 4 to 6ft longer then you can cause a drop in the reading of the charger and the amount of current supplied due to resistance and some other factors. But to compensate for this you can use an extension cord plugged into the wall that is not super long and is 12gauge instead 14 gauge if you have to go beyond like 20 ft. A few extra ft of length of cable for an SAE Charger Clamp is fine but if you get to long it isn't as efficient, so you just want a longer extension cord that can supply current without too much resistance due to extra length, this allows the charger to operate the best.**

[@ThomasWShea](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/309893-thomaswshea.html>) So far, so good. The SC-10 provides current charge rate and voltage via the digital display. The charger reconnects after a simulated power failure and uses the last profile used. For instance, if set up for AGM, it reconnects with AGM charge profile. Currently conducting an extended test. I have the SC-10 connected to my Cayenne’s AGM battery while I’m in Florida for the winter. 😎 I have wife’s LFP battery connected to a CTEK Lithium charger, as well. [@denaliman](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/248743-denaliman.html>) I’m away from vehicle for a while. It uses SAE connectors. I don’t remember the exact length or gauge of the wire. I would guess you may need an extension to reach 12 feet, though. One other note about the wire: It seem stiffer than the more flexible CTEK and NOCO wires.

this is good useful information. I didn’t consider current drop with longer cables. Thanks
