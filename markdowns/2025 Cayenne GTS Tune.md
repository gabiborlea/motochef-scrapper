![Default](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/icons/icon1.gif) **2025 Cayenne GTS Tune**
Hey Everyone.  I have a 2023 Macan GTS that I love. However, I just discovered that we can write off the lease of a new Cayenne GTS under my wife’s business under Section 129 of the tax code. Also, while I love my Macan, it’s Gentian Blue, which is a PIA to keep clean.  I test drove a 25 Cayenne GTS last month. It was very nice and sounded phenomenal with that V8. But….it felt SIGNIFICANTLY slower than my Macan GTS. I know there’s a lot more weight, but I was expecting more. I know some tunes advertise big gains and was wondering if anyone has done it and what their experience has been.  And please. Don’t turn this into a warranty conversation. I just want to know how it impacted torque, acceleration, and driving dynamics.  Thank you!

I did a compare on the Porsche website and based on their numbers the Macan GTS and Cayenne GTS have the same performance 0-60 & 1/4 mile. The more hp the Cayenne has compensates for the 500 pound more weight. I haven’t driven the Macan GTS, only the base, but have ridden in one. It does feel quicker and more agile which is what’s it’s tuned for. The Cayenne GTS with PDCC and RAS will surprise at how well a 5000 pound vehicle can handle.

one thing I’ve learned about Porsche is to never trust their numbers. They always under-promise and over-deliver. With that said, they seek to really undercut their lesser models to maintain their hierarchy. I’m 99% certain my Macan GTS is far quicker than the Cayenne GTS. You get the shove in the back of the seat that the Cayenne didn’t deliver. Maybe some of that has to do with perception though since the Cayenne is quite bigger and heavier. By all means, the Cayenne is very nice and sounds amazing. So not a diss on it. But I’m guessing a tune can lead to significant gains. Hoping someone knows.

I had a '22 Macan GTS and loved it. We recently took delivery of a '25 Cayenne GTS Coupe. I know what you mean when you say that the Cayenne GTS feels slower than the Macan GTS. Macan GTS feels faster because you hear it working harder and it's louder but I'm willing to bet that the Cayenne GTS is just as fast 0-60 or even slightly faster. The V8TT is effortless compared to the V6TT. Cayenne GTS's acceleration is deceiving because it's very smooth. I'd be interested to see the actual results. As for a tune, I'm not sure if there's one out yet. If so, there's significant gains to be had, I'm sure!![](https://rennlist.com/forums/graemlins/burnout.gif)

They 2 cars are probably about the same but the 2.9L V6 delivers torque later, so you feel the surge as it comes in. It feels more athletic than the 4.4L V8, which makes more torque but delivers it in a flatter way. The DCT also feels more responsive than the auto. This feel may be like brake pads. People think the ones that bite hard stop the car sooner but another pad that delivers friction at a more even rate will stop the car in the same distance. Is the 2025 ECU any more protected? Are flash tunes available? If not is there a JB4, Racechip or other piggyback?

A possible challenge for a tune on the 2025 is the new security Porsche has implemented to meet the EU standards. Lots of comments on different forums about the security issues. You would need to contact tuners on availability. Another option would be the GT.

It would be nice to learn of possible tunes as well. I really would like to pull the trigger on a 25 GTS coupe soon, but fear I may be disappointed with the performance. I had a 19 Macan GTS and while it was fun, it was just too small and I thought the performance was mediocre and always wished I opted for the macon turbo or the cayenne turbo (out of my price range at the time). All I need is a reason to start looking at the Turbo GT.... again

It would be nice to learn of possible tunes as well. I really would like to pull the trigger on a 25 GTS coupe soon, but fear I may be disappointed with the performance. I had a 19 Macan GTS and while it was fun, it was just too small and I thought the performance was mediocre and always wished I opted for the macon turbo or the cayenne turbo (out of my price range at the time). All I need is a reason to start looking at the Turbo GT.... again
Our ‘25 GTS Coupe is my wife’s daily but I drive it sometimes. I actually like it a lot as a family hauler with ample performance for our use. If you have a lead foot like me and always want more power, I would buy a TGT. Wishing for something else is torture….been there done that! Life is short.

I am in the market for a Cayenne GTS and cross shopping with the turbo hybrid. The turbo is so much faster after 30mph, but 0-30 they feel similar. I would rather pay 30k less and have a GTS which is 600 pounds lighter and then get a tune. But right now, no one has a tune. Look out for APR to get one. interested to hear an answer to your question. And agree, not interested in a lecture about warranty. Have tuned so many cars and never had an issue

However, I just discovered that we can write off the lease of a new Cayenne GTS under my wife’s business under Section 129 of the tax code.
Did you mean to say Section 179? From previous knowledge, I was aware that only purchases can be deducted (not lease). I’ve not looked into this recently though.

whoops. Yup. Meant 179. I’m in Hawaii on vacation and had a few too many mai tais when writing the post. I’m meeting with my accountant next week and will bet the skinny on the deduction.

Off topic......FWIW I drove my 20 Coupe with 93 Cobb tune, and then the 23 GTS back to back, and GTS feels slower and not as nimble as my Coupe. I was kinda shocked/underwhelmed that 105$k CPO GTS felt. I really want to love it and buy it, but NOPE. Apparently this GTS's 4 wheel steer makes it feel "odd" in twisties? I felt like the car was gonna tip over and death-gripped the wheel the whole time, like odd amount of roll akin to my Gen 2 Platinum. My thought is the GTS should have been better handling and better torque throughout than my Coupe, but wallet remains in my pocket on that deal. The Cobb 93 tune is pretty freaking awesome. GTS does win in the sound department though..........I've had each gen Cayenne Turbo, Platinum comfy version Gen 2, now the tuned Coupe 9Y0 is tighter, and plenty fast, and Sport/Sport + with 93 Cobb will scare you. I sill have not even tried the launch control. My back keeps saying Cayenne and heart sings 911 again. I keep trying the powerful Cayennes though.........

I thought the 179 deduction was being phased out as far as bonus depreciation. I hope I’m wrong. But, I think this year you can only deduct 40%

I took delivery of a 2025 Cayenne Coupe GTS on Saturday and it feels faster than my 2023 Macan GTS.
