Hi everyone, So trying to start my post accident 9y0, and noticed the positive terminal on the battery has a nut and bolt missing, but does anything go there? A picture of anyone's battery positive terminal would be really appreciated please, if anybody has it open! ![](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/smilies/biggrin.gif)!  ![](https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1124/pxl_20220624_164238187_c1e1ffe81a5c2b156b5ece0fb2ad556f40991b4d.jpg)

Just a guess. A lot of dealers use GPS trackers now, that just allows them a place to hook up easily. My dealer always hooks up a GPS tracker to every new car they sell.

Interesting point thank you. Hopefully someone can share a picture of the positive terminal of the battery open, just to confirm!

Here you go [@kash1786](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/283878-kash1786.html>) . 2019 Turbo with original battery. Yes, it looks like another cable should connect to your terminal. Note that my fusible link (current limiter?) is rated at 300 amps and yours has a 150 amp link. Mine has PDCC and RWS which draw high current — that might explain it. The cable disappears under the carpeting. Not sure where it goes.  ![](https://cimg7.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/23ee2be5_16a7_4472_9746_901f2a2a599b_5b1a10db9b940de26734c19199a1d96a71f1cb59.jpeg) ![](https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/60db168c_6b71_4a6a_8fa4_4dd086527453_78995e2ec06caa97c5f013bc8c05e5e77c5bd65a.jpeg)

You may wish to check the remote jumper terminal for 13 volts. One of the big cables runs from the battery to the terminal. I’m guessing you have right-hand drive and your Cayenne’s terminal location may be opposite side. Here’s where mine is:  ![](https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1500x2000/c0e17d45_318e_4883_8731_02bbe7292a76_a4a3528681b5af16e49731582751dd8c0c1ca2c0.jpeg) ![](https://cimg9.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1500x2000/7f81145f_a738_48f3_b495_8d267c65811d_06922fb13421c44dfb33e34d8b8b78ecd2a790d5.jpeg) ![](https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/b66b363e_9e12_4279_ad5b_f161c78e20c5_202bfc67dc5fea9c41eb716995a825ec88f75d8e.jpeg)

Thank you so much, very useful! I'm sure that'll be useful for a lot of people in the future. The Cayenne was involved in an accident, so I wasn't sure if the first responders disconnected something from the terminal as a safety precaution. I don't think they did, I don't see any other wire to connect to it.

Definitely check the cable that goes to the charging post in the engine bay. It should be going under post C and connecting to the big lug in the charging post assembly as seen in this thread: [https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-...-assembly.html](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/1133914-bonding-to-charging-post-assembly.html>)

Will do thank you! I don't see an immediate wire available to connect to the empty slot, but I'll definitely check. The car isn't starting either , but the radiator isn't installed and I have the red warning with low coolant. I thought it should still start, but it's not even cranking? Possible starter motor I think.

Kash, Just ran across this thread and thought I'd add a little info even though it may be unnecessary. I have a Base 2019 and I also have no cable attached to that 150 amp terminal. I imagine there would be one there if your car had an option added that needed it's own dedicated cable. The 150 amp cable directly above the empty one is a dedicated line to the electric power steering rack on my base model. Schnave's 300 amp cable must be for some option he has that uses quite a bit of current.

If [@Schnave](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/107538-schnave.html>)'s vehicle has 48V in the rear, or is hybrid that 300A cable could be for the DC/DC converter that charges the 12V system from the 48V system?

I had the 60Ah LFP (Lithium) battery prior to converting to 92Ah AGM. Due to battery chemistry, the two batteries have equivalent outputs. My PDCC and RWS function just as well with the AGM as they did with the (now defunct) LFP battery.

your cayenne doesn’t have 48V? I thought the porsche dynamic chassis control required 48V to operate the anti sway mechanisms?

Yes, PDCC uses a 48V super capacitor that is charged via a DC-DC step-up converter. It is charged by the 12V system, takes less than 10 seconds to fully charge, and is designed to provide near instantaneous full discharge when needed; a feat that would destroy a LiFePO4 or AGM battery. Here's the simplified electrical system schematic:  ![](https://cimg5.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1220/9477a6a9_4c7b_4fca_b8e7_de08a4fba7a2_ea30ed68837e1719910be8f64cb51cb3c0c60c95.jpeg)

[@Schnave](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/107538-schnave.html>) interesting, in the audi Q8/RSQ8 vehicles in the US, they had a 48V starter generator (now with a super capacitor instead of a battery) and then via the DC/DC converter fed power to the 12V battery to keep it charged. In any event, is that 300A line the connection between the DC/DC converter that gives power to the 48V side?
