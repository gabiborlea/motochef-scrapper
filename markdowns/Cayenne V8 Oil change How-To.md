![Default](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/icons/icon1.gif) **Cayenne V8 Oil change How-To**
Hey all, One existed, then it disappeared, so I’m putting a new one up. This is a relatively straightforward job for those slightly mechanically inclined if you have the tools, a flat surface, and about 2 hours (working slowly with occasional beverage breaks). This could be done in less than 1 hour if it’s your fourth time and you’re in a hurry. Tools include- - Ramps, jack, lift, whatever your method is to get the car up in the air safely. Terrain mode isn’t the easy way. - A small flat-head screw driver - A 7mm ratcheting wrench (the first time) - A ratchet with the following sockets- ​​​​​​— T-25 — T-30 — T-45 — 32mm filter (or any 32mm) — 7mm (subsequent to using the 7mm wrench the first time) - A torque wrench that reads Newton meters - needle-nose pliers, preferably angled - Oil catch can (I prefer a graduated 10 liter bucket) - Oil funnel - lights - (optional) a low powered impact wrench Parts-  ![](https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1701_6c70ffbfe3bb3ad297481cacfafc753336efb165.jpeg) ![](https://cimg9.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1695_d1b5fdf200743c883d8b9627ba78c34e08ac9f96.jpeg) I like to use a new drain plug every time, ever since I owned an E90 M3. Undressing the car- 1. Welcome to your engine bay. We have to remove a lot of this to get to the oil filter. I chose to disassemble the top before I lift the car.  ![](https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1668_2a92be7f3ce37fa1cc308f9d1a5e9b5a06e88d24.jpeg) 2. Remove the two pieces of plastic trim adjacent to each fender and headlight. The rear pulls up and detaches with small green fasteners and two white fasteners that may break off or need the pliers to pull.  ![](https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1673_6d33c2084ade048ed25aff699fd95e21ce4774b2.jpeg) ![](https://cimg1.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1674_827cb4d4fdfea56b5e69c437683c682869d7fbce.jpeg) 3. Remove the hood catch release handle by sliding out a plastic keeper with a small flat-head screwdriver. Lift off the handle.  ![](https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1361/img_1672_9678abfa0acbbba120a61346100bf4f03f32908c.jpeg) 4. Remove the panel below the hood release handle. There are two fasteners that need the center lifted with a small flathead. Lift off, using pliers on any stubborn white fasteners.  ![](https://cimg5.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1754/img_1675_9c75b97dfb4d18fc2d873229b903e70b21c9805c.jpeg) 5. Remove the oil fill cap and then the central air filter cover. This is unfastened with two semi-hidden metal catches, one on each side near the front that you have to pull on firmly.  ![](https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1439/img_1671_abb61779916bd47216eab16e8f9b5d12696af4e0.jpeg) ![](https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1754/img_1670_0f2ca758cd454a73266f898b741f1898276c9a53.jpeg) 6. Remove the two rubber ducts by lifting them straight up and away from the filter housing. For reassembly, not how they lay in the tracks below them.  ![](https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1709/img_1678_52ad0b6ad00e8962524ffc083abc5bc27ef83958.jpeg) ![](https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1681/img_1677_a49aa9473ff323532f8a5ac0e7cd4e2836ceb8e0.jpeg) 7. Detach the oil filler neck from the air filter housing by pressing on the detach while lifting up.  ![](https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1408/img_1676_6edde6672b5b3c095a13a1d71b1f700c7fbd3d0a.jpeg) 8. Because I have done this prior, I had previously rotated the hose clamp to significantly improve accessibility. If the hose clamp screws are hidden use a 7mm ratchet to undo them. If they’ve been rotated like mine, use a 7mm socket and 3-inch extension.  ![](https://cimg6.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1679_d26d9c9465cc9477fbafbf093c6c016c484a81d0.jpeg) 9. Lift the filter housing while separating the hoses from it. Then, pull towards the front of the car to remove from posts at the rear.  ![](https://cimg7.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1325/img_1680_005fa2846d7e3df2caae966b589b42a630504156.jpeg) 10. Remove the aluminum cross-bar. There are three T-30 on each end, two down and one facing the rear. They shouldn’t be more than 1/4” ratchet tight. You’ll need to rotate the bar to lift it out.  ![](https://cimg9.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1667/img_1681_8b955b6ce62e91d55181e7c63af9c885930b03e1.jpeg) 11. The oil filter housing is in the center under the just-removed cross-bar. I like to zip-tie the two O2 sensor wires to the side.  ![](https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1693_89dd029502b7df55133195cbeec8bdf972891793.jpeg) On to underneath. 12. Raise the vehicle. The oil pan doesn’t appear to hold on to much oil if only the front is raised, so feel free to use ramps. Or a lift, or jack stands all around. Just do it safely. I use ramps for convenience 13. To remove the under side cover, there are a lot of T-25 around the edge and three T-45 in the middle. I leave one T-25 in the middle of the front until last so it doesn’t fall on my face. There is a “flap” at the back that requires you to tip the panel to about 30 degrees before you can pull it out. This is why the limited room of “Terrain mode” isn’t nearly enough.  ![](https://cimg4.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1684_c966b786061667b1deeb8f7f55b6fbc48d665979.jpeg) There are a LOT of T-25.  ![](https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1691_404c5c9be603930396cc9cc50400e75e9e4d9df8.jpeg) 14. Remove the oil fill cap under the hood. Underneath the car, the oil drain plug is a T-45 and shouldn’t be torqued much. It will start dripping as soon as it's loose. On any vehicle with an electronic dipstick, I use a graduated bucket. Anyone who changes oil on a 4-liter GT car certainly has one already. Unthread the drain plug and remove it, trying in vain to minimize the mess. Drain the oil.  ![](https://cimg1.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1694_b45a8b1b3bfabe3af33dcf387280a5e26491597c.jpeg) 15. While the oil drains, move up top and use the 32mm to loosen the oil filter housing.  ![](https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1703_ed67add79469f25c9198435bc1555f496f70a3b7.jpeg) 16. Pull out the filter. It will be dripping a lot of oil, so lift it directly up and use a paper towel underneath to cleanly remove it from the engine bay. Pull the filter cartridge out of the housing and remove the rubber O-ring from the outside of the housing. Replace the cartridge with the new one. Dip the O-ring in oil (clean or dirty, it doesn't matter to me) and use the small flathead screw driver to slip it onto the right groove in the filter housing. The cartridge is symmetrical. Either end can go into the housing.  ![](https://cimg5.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1705_9a61206653ea7a417a02321ee0260e874e09746a.jpeg) 17. (Optional) Clean out the filter area of old oil. Paper towels and a small displacement pump can get 95% of it. 18. Place the filter and housing into it’s spot and screw down by hand. The housing should screw on pretty easily. Torque to 25 NM.  ![](https://cimg9.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1706_750a40964c6fbcbf0ec42133725b6f67f90b85dd.jpeg) ![](https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1707_a3e4e1a9cea631f31c6554f0eb98241c5bf1e257.jpeg) 19. Back under that car, hand thread on the new drain plug and crush washer. Wipe the area clean and then torque to 30 Nm. This is NOT a lot of torque. Be careful not to overdo it.  ![](https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1698_c45c458f0c4922cbef331c9d351333dc142df54d.jpeg) 20. Re-install the belly pan. Remember to insert the flap at the rear of the pan, at an angle, into the further rear pan. Tilt up and place one T-25 in the center front. Then the three T-45, then the other mass of T-25. Don’t over tighten. I do use an impact wrench to thread them, but use a ratchet to tighten them.  ![](https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1700_db49cb334edf1a0b2398e6dd267a05cf024c80d2.jpeg) 21. Re-assemble the top end. If your hose clamps weren’t rotated for easy access, do that now. Start with the filter housing by placing the rear onto the posts on the firewall and tilting it down. Fasteners will slip in as you pull the intake hoses around the housing inlet. Re-attach the oil fill hose. Place the two inlet ducts onto the housing and then place the fronts along the guided tracks. Place the front-most cover on and the the two fasteners that press together. Place the cover onto the filter housing and press in the metal clips on each side. Its awkward but they do click into place. Place the hood release handle on it’s gear. The teeth only fit in one orientation. Slip the little catch ring into the side of the handle. Place the side covers back into place, front tongues first. The little green fasteners are not super easy to line up, but you should. 22. Refill the engine with the exact amount of oil you drained. In my case the bucket showed 8.6 liters. Divide that by .946 to get quarts.  ![](https://cimg5.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1273x747/img_1702_c02e82c44afb3a37b4f57e139d238b67701d6254.jpeg) In my case that’s 9 quarts. 23. Close the oil fill. Lower the car safely. Start the Cayenne. Let it run for awhile as you get your iCar-POR plugged in or whatever you use to reset the oil service interval. Reset the oil service interval. Smile that you saved hundreds of dollars. Wish me good karma. 24. The right side gauge selector should be set to “engine stats” and then you press the little rotating ball on the right side of the wheel (the gauge selection ball) to see “oil level”. Press the ball again and the wait an unreasonable amount of time as you ponder the utility of electronic dipsticks. Why did they mess with a perfectly good system? Couldn't they protect themselves with an electronic dipstick and leave us a regular one? Note that there is a plugged dipstick still on the engine if you wanted to use an oil extractor. OK. Eventually, the reading should tell you if you need to add oil, but as long as you added how much you removed, I’ve always had a good result.  ![](https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_1709_06ed488be38b02dd3fcc7d1d3e98f3d7b8869a98.jpeg) I’ve probably missed a couple things, so any feedback is welcome and I’ll happily edit anything if better methods or more accuracy is noted.

![Default](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/icons/icon1.gif) **Great write up!**
Thanks so much for taking the time to post this, [@Visceral](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/163124-visceral.html>) . Will surely help a lot of folks. I changed the oil one time on my CPO turbo and I’m getting ready to do it again. One suggestion for consideration is I always err on the side of caution and put the hood release lever back on its sprocket once I remove the plastic front engine bay cover. If, during the oil change process, one closes the hood for any reason, it’s a pain to open the hood back up without that lever in place. I learned the hard way on my 2017 Q7. Not a crisis, but you have to put the lever somewhere and I find putting it back on the sprocket might just save me trouble later in the process. Just a thought. Thanks again!

Well done. Why did you remove the hood release lever? What oil change step would have been prevented if the hood release lever was left in place?

Note that there is a plugged dipstick still on the engine if you wanted to use an oil extractor.
I used an extractor on my Audi but this is the first I’ve seen it mentioned on this forum. Anyone have experience, good or bad, using an oil extractor for these V-8s? Thanks in advance.

Awesome write up, thank you for this!!! One question, if your still under new car and CPO warranty, is doing the DIY oil changes going to void it or is Porsche dealers going to hassle me for warranty claims? How is y’all’s experience with dealerships on this? I normally do all my own oil changes on all my cars.

You have a right to repair (and maintain) your car. I diy oil changes and the dealer replaced my water pump under warranty. No issues. Diy your oil service with confidence.

Well done. Why did you remove the hood release lever? What oil change step would have been prevented if the hood release lever was left in place?
This allows you to remove the panel underneath the lever (step 4). Without that panel removed, you have to do a bit of finagling to get the ducts off the air filter housing in turn to remove that. When you put everything together, you can't verify that the ducts are in their channels unless the "step 4" panel is removed. You can do that finagling, but I prefer just to pull the panel off and think that's the better (and easier) process to explain.

How is y’all’s experience with dealerships on this? I normally do all my own oil changes on all my cars.
There are cars that I curry favor with the dealer by paying for maintenance. I had a 991.1 Turbo S that required $270 oil changes yearly. For $270, it wasn't worth any future questions. The estimate *I* was given for the inspection and oil change on this Cayenne was $1200. I have a Fidelity Platinum warranty on the car, but it doesn't require dealership service. So far the water pump and the low pressure fuel pump have been replaced at the dealership at over $10k combined. I feel like I've paid my dealership dues to combat any warranty skepticism.

I have an extractor. I may try it next time and see if I get the same 8.6 liters and post back.

Why did you go with ESP 0W-40? M1 5W-40 European Car Formula would have been a better oil/viscosity.

Why did you go with ESP 0W-40? M1 5W-40 European Car Formula would have been a better oil/viscosity.
It’s what the dealer recommended and this particular vehicle is not anywhere that 0W vs. 5W makes any difference.

so the first number is for cold temperature rating. The second number is for when the oil is hot. I always run turbo cars with 0w in the front because you always want the turbo to get oil quickly especially when you first start the car. If you lived in the desert or extremely hot climate, I can see you running a 5w. But I would definitely stick with 0w.

It's not C40 but rather A40. EA825 V8 = C40.
