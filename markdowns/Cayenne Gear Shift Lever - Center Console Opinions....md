I'm looking for a Cayenne for the wife and have recently seen some CPO cars, 2022-2024. Not sure I love that little lever in the dash for changing gears on the 2024 and later cars. Anyone else turned off by that? I think I prefer the substantial looking lever of the pre-2024.

Yes but I like the bigger **** setup where you can toggle the screen better than the other one where the **** is small and not easily accessible with the shifter in the way.

It is the way of the world. Buy the 2023 if that is what suits you. 2023 cars are a good buy now imo.

At first I didn't like this solution in MY2024 either. I thought it looked frivolous in a serious car. But after a few months I got used to it and I think it's a very convenient solution.

I am in agreement with retom on this. Previously I had a 2019 Cayenne and was completely happy with the traditional console-mounted shifter. When I first saw a 9Y0.2 with the dash mounted control - it was a significant surprise and a turn-off for me. However - having just gotten a '24 Cayenne I've had a chance to use the dash mounted shift controller - and bottom line - I really like it. It's conveniently placed. Has a quality appearance with smooth actuation. I also like the fact that there is no vertical obstruction in the center of the console thereby making it easier to interface with the PCM / main display and the console-mounted climate control toggles. It's a winner in my view.  ![](https://cimg1.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1900x2000/img_1457_b21e11cdb29b8cd0d9fac4580e9adc51aaee1c15.jpeg)

I was skeptical about it at first after coming from cars that only had the traditional shifter (M5, X5M, etc). I now own my 24’ CS for 14 months and I can’t stand the traditional shifter anymore. I had a rental on a recent vacation and right when I got in thought “Why was I worried about missing this?” You get a much cleaner center console and the new shifter is quite honestly easier/more comfortable to use.
