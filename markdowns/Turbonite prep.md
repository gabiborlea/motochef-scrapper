Saw the [Turbonite crest](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/www.suncoastparts.com/product/pkturbonite.html>) some time ago and really liked it. Have been a monochrome fan since my bimmer stormtrooper days. Decided to replace the wheel caps first (~$60 shipped) to compare the original vs black/white crests. The caps are from Etsy, appear to be good quality-just a little too tight fit compared to OEM. So far, I am happy with the result and will go for the turbonite hood crest it seems![](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif) Pics:  ![](https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1500x2000/img_3142_07cead330820a5b0611a070abbf07efe54522061.jpeg) ![](https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_3147_3f31e1fec0a3e37b056b0f5362d6073bf7b726c9.jpeg) ![](https://cimg4.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_3150_f8464226eefa4e9d276c295e5439238f476b1dda.jpeg) ![](https://cimg7.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_3163_c61529728f4000a6f037d6043050059d6b134a9c.jpeg)

That is hilarious Shnave! When I was trying to install (beat them in) I chuckled thinking I will get to hear from you on alignment. I remember a previous post by you on that subject![](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif) Anyways, they gave me a hard time getting in so I was going to let them slide hoping you might miss the 15 degrees off of orthodox alignment![](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif)

Me miss an improperly aligned center cap? Not a chance! 😀 You mentioned the caps are a little tight. Instead of spending $42 on a [fancy center cap removal tool](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/www.suncoastparts.com/product/00072192291.html>), you can use an Allen wrench. Just insert the short 90° angle in one of the holes, rotate, and pull. Or, if you want to get creative, you can make your own tool: One coat hanger, pliers, and 5 minutes yielded this handy tool. File the cut ends to form a rounded, non-scratching finish. ![](https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/481befba_9275_4b24_a653_bb39ff51e557_d39b70fcfb9377d70568802f471fa83cdec622a2.jpeg) ![](https://cimg6.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/c6d94ac9_8163_485c_8c2c_dc7162881e86_2118996b2957267ad70dbefdc3d9f5c1d2cd50de.jpeg) ![](https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/5b5ac1cc_f7b7_421e_9d8e_def50416e8de_bea176d122a028cd328a42322016fa10baf09339.jpeg)

Me miss an improperly aligned center cap? Not a chance! 😀 You mentioned the caps are a little tight. Instead of spending $42 on a [fancy center cap removal tool](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/www.suncoastparts.com/product/00072192291.html>), you can use an Allen wrench. Just insert the short 90° angle in one of the holes, rotate, and pull. Or, if you want to get creative, you can make your own tool: One coat hanger, pliers, and 5 minutes yielded this handy tool. File the cut ends to form a rounded, non-scratching finish. ![](https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/481befba_9275_4b24_a653_bb39ff51e557_d39b70fcfb9377d70568802f471fa83cdec622a2.jpeg) ![](https://cimg6.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/c6d94ac9_8163_485c_8c2c_dc7162881e86_2118996b2957267ad70dbefdc3d9f5c1d2cd50de.jpeg) ![](https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/5b5ac1cc_f7b7_421e_9d8e_def50416e8de_bea176d122a028cd328a42322016fa10baf09339.jpeg)
yep, used allen wrenches (per another post of yours![](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif) and the OEMs popped easily out. The Etsy replacements though put up a fight. To a point that I broke a tab on one of them while "persuading it" to get with the program.

I think it's hysterical that for years Porsche has cheaped out by providing black only wheel cap centers, where the colored crests were a cost option. Now they introduce black only wheel caps and hood graphics on the Turbo and give it a fancy name and it's hugely popular. Kind of like growing up cars in the late 80's and early 90's, the glossy black plastic mirror caps and door handles meant you didn't spend enough for the fancy version with painted mirrors and handles. Now there is an upcharge to paint those glossy black. Crazy, lol.

Didn't Dr. Seuss write a book about this? I spent my teenage years wanting Red Brembro brakes...now I pay $900 to paint them black. I'd probably pay $1,800 for a no paint, reduce caliper paint weight option...:-)

I found the official Porsche removal tool online.. it’s about $50. Did the coat hanger you made work ok? Didn’t scratch up the center caps getting them out? even though you broke a tab..do the aftermarket ones fit ok? I found a gloss set on ebay the look just like the ones you found on Etsy..only in gloss black to match my wheels for $50 a set. I’m tempted to try them and grab the turbonite crest for my white/black Cayenne . ![](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif)

Kind of like growing up cars in the late 80's and early 90's, the glossy black plastic mirror caps and door handles meant you didn't spend enough for the fancy version with painted mirrors and handles. Now there is an upcharge to paint those glossy black. Crazy, lol.
I had (still do) the same thought when I saw car makers started blacking out everything.
