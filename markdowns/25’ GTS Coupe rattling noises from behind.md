Hello eveyone! just picked up my new ‘25 GTS Coupe. I hear rattling noises from the rear part of the cabin while driving. Has anyone experienced this?

So far mine has not rattled- 2 weeks old. Did you maybe check underneath where the spare is to make sure everything is secured? Rear seat back properly engaged?

I recall this post: [https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-...l#post19768017](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/1163541-rattles-in-rear-hatch-anyone-else-2.html#post19768017>) I have notice in my 2024 base coupe i get an occasional rattle back in that area, but it hasn't escalated to a point where I felt compelled to investigate yet. You could also review the spare tire & accessories to make sure everything is aligned, seated correctly and snug i have had cars where the spare wasn't snugged down, and doing this resolved some noises. you could even remove that item temporarily to see if something involved w that is making the noise.

It's hard to tell from your video if I had the same sound, but I brought my 23 GTS coupe in this week for a clunking rattling noise in the rear. They determined the rear hatch latches needed adjustment and had it back to me in 2 hours. No rattle since!

thank you for very useful link. I will begin with adjustment of rear hatch latches.

it was recorded without spare kit, without warning triangle, with folded rear seats. I also checked all panels. It looks like the sound is coming from the lock and hinge of the trunk door.

folded rear seats? my experience is that if the seats are folded down, rattles. if they are all the way back, as far as they will go, no rattles. that said, at least that one other person had hatch latch rattles. so that lines up too.

No matter, folded or unfolded seats. Noise is the same. I folded seats to hear it clearly. thanks, will ask somebody to try to catch this noise in the rear.

I think, I found the problem: The trunk position is lower than normal, and the gaps with the fender are uneven. This may be the cause of the rattling noise in the hatch latches.  ![](https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_5458_1fda22965ec1bc2a755868ec2de1736fdfaca833.jpeg)
