![Default](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/icons/icon1.gif) **Turbo GT All Season Tires - Unique Situation**
I'm sure I'll get some heat for this, but I'd like to switch from the summer performance tires that came with my 2024 Turbo GT. I have other vehicles and this isn't a track car for me. I drive pretty aggressive on the street, but anyone who properly knows the limits of the this vehicle knows it's still very difficult to push those on public, twisty back roads due to oncoming traffic, bikers, etc. I know many people think they push the limits but aren't even close (not saying that's you). With that said, the main reason I want to switch is because I own a bit of land (where there are gravel roads) are there are times I'm out and want to go around the property without switching vehicles or hopping in a side by side. With any summer performance tires, they kick up EVERYTHING, especially when they're warm. I'm in TN and not worried about snow, this switch is purely so it doesn't kick up as much debris. I believe a lot of other Cayenne models come with (or can come with) all season tires, so I'm hoping some people have some input on this. I know I'll be giving up track performance, but there are street benefits to all season tires like a lot less debris kick up, they don't have to warm up as much (especially in the 40's and 50's which is quite a bit here), etc. The below appear to be the only two all season tires that are OEM size. Has anyone put all seasons on their TGT? Or has anyone experienced these or similar on any other models, especially if you enjoy some spirited driving? Just going by pictures, the Yokohama's look to be a little more toward the winter side than the Pirelli (not saying that's a bad thing).  ![](https://cimg1.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1222x1054/image_3ef6b6e0ab6cadfedfdd5e2337123b8c9fc47669.png) ![](https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1257x1056/image_da36291733c025cbe32e9a7f828b86b1e5edc1c4.png)

I like the Scorpion Verde A/S but don’t see that they come in your size. What tires do the 2024 S and GTS come with, when 22” wheels are chosen?

If you went down to 21s, you'd have additional options: [https://www.suncoastparts.com/catego...rbochawws.html](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/www.suncoastparts.com/category/9y02cayeneturbochawws.html>) but i imagine you're not interested in the size down, though, i think there is a clone turbo gt wheel that you can get in a 21 inch size that i recall someone on here having.

Thanks for the info. I want to stick with the stock wheels that I have, which I know really limits me. I just tried building the S, GTS and Turbo e-hybrid and none of them are offering all-season tires with 22" wheels at this time. I read somewhere that they may have take that option away for the time being. When they were offering this, I wonder if it was just inventory that made them spec some with the Pirelli's and some with the Yokoama's.

I know I can't get this exact tire, but being an all season tire, do you use these outside of winter and have you been happy with them in terms of still holding the road pretty good, not kicking much debris up, etc?

The tires that the OP has noted above are the size of the tires on the '24 Cayenne base that I just purchased. Yokohama Advan All Seasons

The tires that the OP has noted above are the size of the tires on the '24 Cayenne base that I just purchased. Yokohama Advan All Seasons
Are they the Advan V35a or Advan Sport A/S? And have you been happy with them?

I know on the SQ8 I just traded in I had Hankook Dynapro H2 on 22" wheels. They were "All-Season". I was happy with them but I'm not very demanding when it comes to putting tires through their paces. The Cayenne I picked up has Bridgestone Alenza (again All-Season) but they're on 21" rims (and ceramic brakes). However, the Bridgestone site shows the Alenza available in your size. Good luck.

Advan V35A Too early on for me to provide any meaningful feedback. I just picked up the car earlier today.

Thanks for the info. I want to stick with the stock wheels that I have, which I know really limits me. I just tried building the S, GTS and Turbo e-hybrid and none of them are offering all-season tires with 22" wheels at this time. I read somewhere that they may have take that option away for the time being. When they were offering this, I wonder if it was just inventory that made them spec some with the Pirelli's and some with the Yokoama's.
Our Turbo E Hybrid with 22’s came with all seasons standard. I actually do not like them, car wanders a lot. Just got a large update and I am waiting to see if it adjusted the suspension tuning or PDCC. If not I may actually try the summers for a stiffer sidewall.

Had a wandering problem at highway speed. The alignment was messed up, front and rear. Made a significant difference in holding straight ahead travel after alignment correction at the dealer. Was running the factory 21inch all season scorpions which have since been replaced with all season Yokohamas

We had them check everything, they blamed it on the 22” all seasons. My wife likes the car and its hers, if I had my way I would get rid of it.

I have 24 TGT with Yokohama A/S and they are OK, not as good as other brands on Cayenne. The steering looses more than the expected amount of precision, slightly squirrelly. I will get the Pirelli’s for my next set of A/S, as I have had their snow tires on previous turbo S cayennes and they drive great. I put the summer tires on for about half the year.

Thanks for sharing this. This pushed me to order the Pirelli's and give those a try. Thanks for all the other comments. I should have these installed in a couple weeks and will let you know my thoughts, incase anyone else is in the same boat.
