![Default](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/icons/icon1.gif) **Funky "professional" headlights adjustment**
Asked my beloved Porsche dealership to recalibrate and adjust the headlights for my Cayenne Turbo 2021 (equipped with PDLS+). The pictures below show how the low beam looks like after set up. I couldn't even drive without possibly causing an accident since the height of the headlight was set up to flood the moon with light rather than the road. Got flashed so many times on my way back home and it wasn't even completely dark. It took me 14 360 degrees turns on the screws to have them back at an acceptable height, 14 full turns!!!! So I am wondering... since it is the second time I get this result from that dealership and they had to lower it down once, does anyone experienced the same in the past? I am trying to determine if it is incompetence or there is another notorious problem with setting up Porsche headlights height in the US... Oh boy... (facepalm)  ![](https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/pz3_79a8a01303c683c55b6b99be01232ba9cf6a116b.jpg) ![](https://cimg1.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/pz1_d130bfd21b4774c2ac4d464066c1444d9d264c7c.jpeg) ![](https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/pz2_4933b3f2d15c26ba0a9eec71c5d76def53381584.jpeg)

i assumed these lights self adjust and that you’d see them move down then up every time you turn them on, and that any other adjustment would be related to a fixture being replace due to accident damage or body work etc.

Sorry I don't understand could you please elaborate more? Are you saying the vehicle has been in an accident and the mechanism is damaged? The headlights were perfectly fine (and the car too), I've just asked for some recalibration and readjustment due a feeling they were low. So they just raised them up, but that much. I adjusted it down and they are fine now after each start. I just don't understand why they were coming back that high from the dealership. What's your point?

I suspect someone at your Porsche dealership doesn't understand the headlight aiming instructions. That the throw of the PDLS+ LED-Matrix low beam is set too low at the factory for U.S. market models has been a complaint on this forum. When I mentioned it, I think it was [@Schnave](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/107538-schnave.html>) who directed me to a thread that described how to raise the low beams a little and by how many turns of the screws. I didn't follow the instructions for raising the beams since I had planned before purchase to have the headlights re-programed to function as in Europe. Raising the low beams a little might help some but reprogramming for Europe (or possibly Canada) makes that unnecessary. My take is that the LED-matrix low beam was not designed to function without the LED-matrix high beam being adaptive. After reprogramming, the now adaptive high beam switches on at 30 km/h (18.6 mph) as long as the roadway isn't adequately illuminated by other lights including overhead lights and the headlights of other traffic. Other vehicles are "shaded out" by individual LED's switching on an off so that occupants of those vehicles aren't blinded or irritated. Prior to re-programming, the then non-adaptive high beam didn't switch on until at least 60 km/h (37.6 mph) by which time I had been significantly overdriving the low beams. Anthony of 9XX.com reprogrammed the headlights of my 2022 Cayenne during one of his annual circuits around the U.S. Others have offered similar services by remote and some members have done it themselves using pirated PIWIS software.

Thank you [@Woofman](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/280903-woofman.html>) that is great info. Indeed, PCNA and Porsche service centers aren't inclined to "unlock" the full potential of the PDLS+ features. It's just software and it is now legal. I've hit the wall on that twice. I come from Europe and we had this technology already 12 years ago and I am missing it. There is no way with them. There must be a reason why it is so but well. I'll have a look at 9XX thanks!

Thank you [@ThomasWShea](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/309893-thomaswshea.html>)! Yes, Porsche PDLS/HD Matrix etc. is a "story" here in the US. So I'll just attribute what happened as incompetence resp. being confused on the process, maybe it's Porsche who is to blame here, and the technician just followed "wrong" or confusing instructions, not sure. Anyway, not first world problems. I lowered it down to where it should be, tried to get it 100% symmetric and good to go. I just threw $150 away. $5 per turn :-p

Yes I will try, studying the whole thing as we speak. Feels a lot of $$$ (which is totally ok given the value it gives back in my books) but also feels a lot of effort (the challenge for me). Even with the 9xx solution, they want a online call/consultation first, etc. etc. kind of complicated, seems like there is a "whole experience" universe I just don't need, I just need the coding and the re-coding warranty in case Porsche put it back at default US settings. Maybe I read this wrong, I'll figure out. Maybe there are other more simple options. It's just my current perception. But yes, totaly worth it imo. I know this feature and it is phenomenal.

Asked my beloved Porsche dealership to recalibrate and adjust the headlights for my Cayenne Turbo 2021 (equipped with PDLS+). The pictures below show how the low beam looks like after set up. I couldn't even drive without possibly causing an accident since the height of the headlight was set up to flood the moon with light rather than the road. Got flashed so many times on my way back home and it wasn't even completely dark. It took me 14 360 degrees turns on the screws to have them back at an acceptable height, 14 full turns!!!! So I am wondering... since it is the second time I get this result from that dealership and they had to lower it down once, does anyone experienced the same in the past? I am trying to determine if it is incompetence or there is another notorious problem with setting up Porsche headlights height in the US... Oh boy... (facepalm)  ![](https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/pz3_79a8a01303c683c55b6b99be01232ba9cf6a116b.jpg) ![](https://cimg1.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/pz1_d130bfd21b4774c2ac4d464066c1444d9d264c7c.jpeg) ![](https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/pz2_4933b3f2d15c26ba0a9eec71c5d76def53381584.jpeg)
Ha! Please please tell me you're in Tennessee and went to the same dealer i did. This EXACT issue got me "banned" from the dealer because I went back and told them they did it incorrectly and explained how to fix it to them. Now they refuse to work on my Cayenne Turbo S e-hybrid for any reason. In fact, I have to drive to hours today to the next closest dealer for scheduled service, vs going five minutes up the road. PCNA can't do anything and the dealer itself all the way up to the owner refuse to communicate with me about their issue.

I suspect someone at your Porsche dealership doesn't understand the headlight aiming instructions. That the throw of the PDLS+ LED-Matrix low beam is set too low at the factory for U.S. market models has been a complaint on this forum. When I mentioned it, I think it was [@Schnave](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/107538-schnave.html>) who directed me to a thread that described how to raise the low beams a little and by how many turns of the screws. I didn't follow the instructions for raising the beams since I had planned before purchase to have the headlights re-programed to function as in Europe. Raising the low beams a little might help some but reprogramming for Europe (or possibly Canada) makes that unnecessary. My take is that the LED-matrix low beam was not designed to function without the LED-matrix high beam being adaptive. After reprogramming, the now adaptive high beam switches on at 30 km/h (18.6 mph) as long as the roadway isn't adequately illuminated by other lights including overhead lights and the headlights of other traffic. Other vehicles are "shaded out" by individual LED's switching on an off so that occupants of those vehicles aren't blinded or irritated. Prior to re-programming, the then non-adaptive high beam didn't switch on until at least 60 km/h (37.6 mph) by which time I had been significantly overdriving the low beams. Anthony of 9XX.com reprogrammed the headlights of my 2022 Cayenne during one of his annual circuits around the U.S. Others have offered similar services by remote and some members have done it themselves using pirated PIWIS software.
I wish we could get an update from Anthony, as I was slated for his 2024 tour, which never happened. I really need to dedicate the time to looking into doing it myself.

​​​​​The video call with Anthony is to make sure you're a real person, have supported hardware on the car, and frankly, you're not going to murder him when he comes to you and works on your car. Takes just a few minutes. I'm hoping he finds time to do the tour this year. ​​

Please post up and let me know how it goes. Communication with him is a bit spotty for me and I can't get any answers to all my questions. I've contacted him through here and email. Maybe I'm missing something and it's my fault - entirely possible! I have two vehicles that I'd love to get this done to!

Surely there's more to the story. I've had to take my Cayenne to the Porsche dealership twice for one problem, three times for another problem and four times for still another problem. And I had to provide the Porsche dealer service writer with the service campaign code to get my Offroad surface type menu fixed. If anything, the dealership appreciated the information I provided since that allowed them to fix the problem on other Cayennes and make money doing it.

9xx isn't Anthony's full time occupation but I'm disappointed he didn't do his 2024 tour as planned. Life happens. Where in Tennessee are you? It's only 250 miles from Nashville to Atlanta where Anthony lives. Others have driven their Porsches to Anthony to have him re-program their LED-matrix headlights and (I think) make other modifications. I drove 230 miles to rennllist member [@bearcat2000](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/289421-bearcat2000.html>) 's house to have Anthony re-program my headlights due to my retirement home garage being too small to comfortably work in. Driving your Cayenne to Anthony could be a fun road trip.

Surely there's more to the story. I've had to take my Cayenne to the Porsche dealership twice for one problem, three times for another problem and four times for still another problem. And I had to provide the Porsche dealer service writer with the service campaign code to get my Offroad surface type menu fixed. If anything, the dealership appreciated the information I provided since that allowed them to fix the problem on other Cayennes and make money doing it. 9xx isn't Anthony's full time occupation but I'm disappointed he didn't do his 2024 tour as planned. Life happens. Where in Tennessee are you? It's only 250 miles from Nashville to Atlanta where Anthony lives. Others have driven their Porsches to Anthony to have him re-program their LED-matrix headlights and (I think) make other modifications. I drove 230 miles to rennllist member [@bearcat2000](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/289421-bearcat2000.html>) 's house to have Anthony re-program my headlights due to my retirement home garage being too small to comfortably work in. Driving your Cayenne to Anthony could be a fun road trip.
I'd absolutely do that and go to him. Just can't ever get in touch with the guy. I've sent a few emails and screen scheduled another teams meeting. I'll reach out again.
