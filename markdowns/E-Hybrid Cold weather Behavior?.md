![Default](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/icons/icon1.gif) **E-Hybrid Cold weather Behavior?**
We recently ordered a Cayenne E-Hybrid and are excited for its arrival! While we likely won't face significant cold weather until next winter, I'd like to understand how the vehicle operates in low temperatures. We're transitioning from a Pacifica PHEV, which has a single drive mode. It prioritizes electric power until additional demand or battery depletion necessitates the internal combustion engine (ICE). In our experience, when starting from a 50°F garage in sub-32°F weather, the van initially uses electric power, including cabin and battery heating. After a mile or two, the ICE starts to optimize battery and cabin temperature. On my 6-mile commute, this typically results in the ICE running for about half the distance. Conversely, when preconditioning the van while plugged in and parked outside in sub-32°F weather, the ICE immediately activates for rapid warming. During the commute, the ICE may cycle on and off, a few times, but primarily electric power is used, albeit with higher consumption due to prolonged heater usage. Does the Cayenne E-Hybrid function similarly in cold weather?

my experience is you'll lose range and power but can stay full EV if you so desire - however the ICE kick in thresholds are much lower…preconditioning the cabin while it's plugged in to the garage EVSE will help … range/power are restored when ambient temperatures warm up. You still have battery power - just less to go around - if necessary Porsche's excellent hybrid-management software will "kick in" the ICE should you "need" it. But once the power demand subsides the ICE will go back to idle

My '24 S E Hybrid does not stay in E Power once temps (air temps, not ambient temps) are below zero. It was -4 (F) last Tuesday and the ICE kicked in after 1 mile in E Power. My '20 E Hybrid was in TX, so never saw air temps below 15 (F), it would stay in E Power at those temperatures.

From ours in Avon where it is now -8, you can get it to stay epower but you have to be super tender on the throttle. Neil the battery warms up any medium to firm acceleration will kick the ice

Here’s what I’ve noticed so far this Winter. Context: The 2024 Cayenne E-Hybrid is parked in a garage which does not go below 5C (40F). Once it’s outside, if the ambient temperature is below -10C (14F), the ICE will fire up and the vehicle operates similar to Hybrid mode. The ‘cold weather trigger point’ to start the ICE automatically is much higher than the previous gen E-Hybrid (9Y0). I trust there’s good engineering reasons for this.

Lithium batteries have a pretty narrow temperature range which they like to operate in. It's definitely not just "colder is better". My guess would be that the resistive heater can only provide so much output and combined load between cabin demand and heating the battery exceeds the capacity of the electric heater. Given that mine is garaged in Houston....no real world experience and although it'll be in the 20's tomorrow here, we aren't going anywhere with the predicted wintry mix / snow.

Interesting you should post this, as it was the coldest morning of the year so far here: 29F. I garage my car, so the battery is always ~55F when I leave and do my commute 99% on E-Power only most days. This morning just down my driveway on E-power, the ICE engine kicked in, and stayed on for about 1/2 mile. That never happens in E-Power mode unless the battery is depleted or cold. The battery said it was in the normal temp range (the grey bar on the left gauge on this photo from earlier this fall below), so it needed to warm something up I guess, though I’m not sure what. I am more conscious of how cold the engine oil temp is most of the time now that the weather is cold. The Engineering Explained YouTube channel had an interesting video on Mobil One’s new oil formulated specifically for hybrids, which evidently have more trapped water in their oil because they don’t often run the ICE long enough to get hot enough to evaporate the water. I’d never even thought of that. Anyway just be conscious of “flooring it” in the cold weather where you’ll rev the ICE really high on cold oil. I generally try and do my commute on E-power only, and switch to sport mode to warm it up well before I take the turn off for the curvy road home to enjoy the V8 and what this car was made for. ![](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif) ![On the far left: the boost guage shows battery assist to the V8 for torque fill during turbo spin-up.

Maxfps, Thanks for the reply, It sems to act very similar to our old PHEV Van, when it was cold. I did see the EE video on the Hybrid oll. Which makes sense. The Van would kick on the ice after so many months and would only run only on ice until it depleted enough fuel that you could add 6+ gallons then it would allow it to run on Electric only again. They called it FORM Fuel/Oil Refresh Mode. Supposed to burn the moisture out of the engine and use up old gas. The thing I'm going to enjoy about this setup, instead of rolling down the hwy at 80 and the battery hitting zero and the ice kicking straight on we can choose to warm it up nicely before needing it. Like you do towards the end of your drive.

So in this scenario, when the outside temperature is fairly low (20-40 degrees), and a fully charged Cayenne, with no preconditioning, is operating in E-Power mode, is there any cabin heat? And where does it come from?

[@Valvefloat991](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/186337-valvefloat991.html>) I would assume since there is the preconditioning feature, that these vehicle have electric heat. No traditional heater core. I have heard on some of the EV channels that in the land of EVs, you are smart to use heated seats when it is cold because it is more efficient to warm yourself with direct contact w heat, than w heated air. The heated air takes more energy for you to feel warm.

yes Porsche hybrid's have heat/cool with no ICE motor running - but that comes as the expense of "range" - heating is more expensive than cooling in terms of battery impact/consumption... what most people don't realize but I think is cool - is that Porsche's hybrid's are actually "full EV" in terms of redesign of the vehicle not to depend on the ICE motor "running" for normal operations (like heat, cool, power steering, braking, etc…) - it's one of the reasons auto-start/stop w/hybrid is a better experience in the hybrid vehicles.

That's good to hear, and I understand that the heat provided uses energy. Do you know if the e-Hybrid uses a heat pump to generate this heat? Or simple resistance heating?

I do not know specifically - and it could also vary by generation/region (I know for a fact that Taycan/Macan has had heat pump or no heat pump vary by region/standard-equipment) the best thing to do and reduce the "impact" of heating the cabin is to pre-heat the cabin while the Hybrid is plugged in at home - it will use "shore power" as part of the pre-heating leaving maximum range - also cabin heating is "less expensive" once it's up to the "set temp" in terms of maintainng the temp vs. bringing it up from cold while also driving… heated steering wheel and seats uses less battery power than cabin air temp heating - but wiht a hybrid these sort of optimization are less critical since you have a 300-400 mile range extender with a 500 HP Turbo V8/V6 ![](https://rennlist.com/forums/graemlins/rockon.gif) who's one main "pro" is heat is a waste product…

Preheat makes sense, though since I'm mostly retired, my driving schedule is fairly random. I don't think I want to preheat the car for several hours each day.
