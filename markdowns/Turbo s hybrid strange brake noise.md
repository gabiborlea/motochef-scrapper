![Default](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/icons/icon1.gif) **Turbo s hybrid strange brake noise**
I can’t make out the exact sound but during light braking (under 5mpg) I notice a strange mechanical noise coming from the regen part of breaking. It’s not a squeal or squeek that you normally hear from worn brake pads, but instead has various high pitched tones with some fluids moving around. Has anyone experience this?

it’s not a clicking sound. Sound seems to be correlated with brake pressure, brake regen or pads. Can’t figure it out

Are you hearing the pedestrian warning sound, which comes on at speeds under about 20 mph and goes off once you hit that speed? It will come back if you dip below that speed (when operating in battery mode, obviously. Will not happen with engine running). The "fluids moving" sound makes me think that.

In most of the markets, Turbo S trim level is sold with PCCB as standard. Ceramic brakes generally require higher pressure to work, which is translated to the pedal feeling. Thus, you might have been applying less pressure than required to tell the gearbox to not use the electric power. Observe "E-Power" gauge when you're pressing your brake pedal when you're stationary. If it indicates even a small amount of electric energy being used, it's coming from your gearbox, which is fighting against the braking action. To cut down the electric energy, you have to press the brake pedal firmly. When you see the 'HOLD', it's already gone. You shouldn't hear that humm. My wife does that very often, I don't think it may cause any issues, however, the integration of ceramic brakes, gearbox and the hybrid system is flawed there. The sound is probably coming from torque converter and the small electric motor. It's the sound you hear when torque converter enclosure has less oil than needed or the oil is too old. I've used 5 TSE Cayennes when I was shopping around. Every single one did that.

this is helpful. Yea I did notice that you have to be firm at idle. Something to note. I’m not talking about the whirring noise under 20mph. My wife says it sounds like a bubbling noise. Once I pump the brakes and give it some pressure, it seems to go away

is it speed dependent?
it really happens under 5-8 mph under regen braking

its 99.9% likely the safety pedestrian noise - regulations require EV's to make noise below 20 mph (or some such limit) the noise you're hearing is most likely artificial to alert pedestrians to your presence regen braking has no "noise" because it's simple running the electrical motor "backwards" as a generator which converts kinetic energy into electrical energy - the direction of electron flow has no noise associated with it.

hmm that would make sense, but the noise goes away once the brake has some pressure in it (via pumping the brakes). It literally sounds like artificial bubbles in the brakes

the low "hum" is the pedestrian "noise" - the warble that cresendo's is a noise I'm unfamilar with - my 2021 Cayenne eHybrid makes no such noise. have you had a dealer service look at it?

It's abnormal. I have never heard anything like this. Get it checked in a dealership, could lead to sudden pressure loss of brake line hydraulics.

I can’t make out the exact sound but during light braking (under 5mpg) I notice a strange mechanical noise coming from the regen part of breaking. It’s not a squeal or squeek that you normally hear from worn brake pads, but instead has various high pitched tones with some fluids moving around. Has anyone experience this?
In most of the markets, Turbo S trim level is sold with PCCB as standard
