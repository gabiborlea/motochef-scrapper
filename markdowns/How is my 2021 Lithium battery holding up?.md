Hello fellow Porsche fanatics! I recently purchased a CPO 2021 Cayenne S with ~42k miles. I've been a life long Porsche guy, having owned numerous aircooled 911s and for the past few years I've been enoying a 987.2 Cayman S. I've been really enjoying the Cayenne S over these past few weeks including learning about all it's nuances... the stock Lithium battery being one of them! The battery in my SUV is the original battery with a 2021 date code and "passed" the CPO testing, whatever that means. To try and stay ahead of Porsche lithium battery issues I went ahead and purchased the [Antigravity Battery Tracker PLUS](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/antigravitybatteries.com/products/accessories/battery/chargers/btr3-bluetooth-tracker/>) and the new [SC-10 Super-Charger](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/antigravitybatteries.com/products/super-chargers/sc-10/>). The tracker device is neat, providing lots of valuable info. One thing I've noticed with the tracker is that my battery seems to settle on 13.17 volts at rest, or about 55-58% charged . Yesterday I used the super-charger for the first time and charged the battery to 100% capacity (according to the tracker and charger) which ended up at 14.54 volts. After disconnecting the charger the battery drifted back down to 13.32 volts, where it stayed until I drove the vehicle last night. I noticed while driving the Cayenne, and afterwards while it was parked, and again this morning, the battery is back to 13.17 ish volts. I have also done the cranking test with the tracker and it says the cranking voltage is OK, within standard range, at 11.47 volts. Sooooo... what do you guys think about the current condition of my battery? Any guesses on how much longer the 2021 date code stock Porsche lithium battery will last before it starts to become problematic? I don't have any low voltage errors on the dash, the vehicle seems to be perfectly fine, yet I'm a bit concerned that a resting voltage of 13.17 volts is on the low side for a lithium battery? The original warranty on my Cayenne expires in August, then I have 2 years of CPO coverage, though I'm not sure how much resistance I would be facing from Porsche to try and get the battery eventually replaced under warranty vs. doing the mods needed to switch to an AGM battery (or AGM mods yet using an Antigravity lithium battery). Thanks for any feedback you provide! I am looking forward to contributing to the Rennlist Cayenne forum!  ![](https://cimg5.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1299/img_0462_e13f269e4a154d8c38754a85d2cb1c779109ccce.jpg)

Drive at steady speed approx 45-50mph then take your foot off the accelerator pedal. Watch the voltmeter. What values does it give you when coasting?

High 14’s. Let’s say 14.7 ish on a long coast. Sometimes lower… say 13.9 on a shorter coast. edit: another neat thing about the tracker - during coasting the tracker shows a “charging” status.

One of the more insidious things about these LiFePO4 batteries is that the point of failure may not be that predictable. Case in point - I purchased a 2019 Cayenne base with one of these batteries in December 2023. The car had 39k miles on it. It was purchased as a (fully inspected and ok'd) CPO vehicle. The battery checked out fine. Two days after I picked up the car, the battery was completely dead. The local Porsche dealer where I purchased the car conveyed that the battery was completely gone. It did end up being replaced under warranty. I don't know if it was under the CPO warranty or the emissions warranty. The cost to me was nothing - other than the inconvenience of the situation. It seems like it would make good sense for you to formulate a replacement plan now. I would have a conversation with your Porsche dealer and perhaps mention that you are aware of the troublesome nature of these batteries and that based on the age of your Cayenne, that you're looking to identify a solution path in advance. Best of luck with the process. Your Cayenne looks fantastic by the way.

What is the build date on the 2019 and how many miles did it have when you bought it?

I don't recall the exact build date - it was an early 2019 build in 2018. May have been as early as March or April of 2018 - I can't remember. The car had just under 39k miles on it when I purchased it.

Contrary to what I keep reading on this forum, my dealer told me that Porsche is still installing LiFeP04 batteries in new Cayennes. He said they are well aware of past problems, but they haven't seen any for several years now, Porsche figured out the problem, and corrected it (according to the shop foreman). I had them check my '23 when it was in for its annual service a couple of weeks ago.

Battery seems OK.
While I don't disagree I do wonder why you say that? A reason why I ask is simply to further my knowledge of these Cayennes and their lithium batteries. Thanks for the help!

One of the more insidious things about these LiFePO4 batteries is that the point of failure may not be that predictable.
Ugh... agreed. I was an early adopter of lightweight lithium batteries in my aircooled 911s. It didn't go well and was a costly experiment. After saying that I do believe the technology has matured over the past 5+ years.

Case in point - I purchased a 2019 Cayenne base with one of these batteries in December 2023. The car had 39k miles on it. It was purchased as a (fully inspected and ok'd) CPO vehicle. The battery checked out fine. Two days after I picked up the car, the battery was completely dead. The local Porsche dealer where I purchased the car conveyed that the battery was completely gone. It did end up being replaced under warranty. I don't know if it was under the CPO warranty or the emissions warranty. The cost to me was nothing - other than the inconvenience of the situation. It seems like it would make good sense for you to formulate a replacement plan now. I would have a conversation with your Porsche dealer and perhaps mention that you are aware of the troublesome nature of these batteries and that based on the age of your Cayenne, that you're looking to identify a solution path in advance.
I think I read in this forum, and have my own hunch, that the 2019 Cayennes didn't have proper BMS (battery management) logic and ended up contributing to premature battery failure. Updates to the logic in the later cars (and eventually also applied to the 2019s) helped the situation yet the batteries are still finicky. Although if the 2019 batteries had already suffered due to less than ideal BMS logic then they are already prone to early failure, even with the logic updates applied. I agree on developing a proactive replacement game plan to minimize battery headaches. That plan has already started with me installing the Antigravity battery tracker and making this Rennlist post! I also have an annual inspection appt with the dealer coming up and plan to discuss my concerns with them at that point (mostly battery and engine cooling concerns). I already have the parts to do an AGM conversion yet will be holding off on that as long as I can, especially while the Cayenne is under warranty.

Best of luck with the process. Your Cayenne looks fantastic by the way.

My understanding is the new Cayennes that are optioned with rear axle steering also get LiFeP04 batteries. No rear axle steering = AGM battery.

Without the tender the variables would be any parasitic drain over 50mA (if yes, you'd want to mitigate that), or, if the battery fails a load test. A tender can mask issues if you have parasitic drain. I do not know the exact details for the porsche 12V LiFePO4 battery, but a typical 12V LiFePO4 battery would have:

You are right in no-man's land at 13.17V. It's okay. Definitely, not bad.

2024 forward is all AGM as far as the 12V side goes. Some models have 48V batteries in addition in the rear of the vehicle for certain features. I am not sure if those 48V batteries are LiFeP04 or super caps - I know audi moved to super caps. Hybrids run those features of off the hybrid vehicle battery, but they still have a 12V AGM as well.

I've got the AGM conversion kit ready to go, however I'm not ready to install it just yet since the vehicle is under warranty and I don't want to start a blame game if an electrical issue arises during the warranty period. I'll be discussing my battery concerns with the local dealer when I take it in for annual inspection in 2 weeks. My Cayenne just went through the CPO certification process literally a few weeks ago at a different dealer, which is supposed to include a battery load test. I don't think Porsche will do much to proactively replace the battery if it recently "passed" CPO certification and it's not generating any error codes in the vehicle. To start wrapping up this thread - I'll continue to monitor the lithium battery with the tracker, I'll share my concerns with the dealer, and if the issue starts getting annoying then I'll move forward with the AGM conversion. Thank you for the feedback everyone!
