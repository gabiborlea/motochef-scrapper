Purchased a 2025 Cayenne Coupe GTS on Saturday. It was dealer inventory with 40 miles. Active Lane Keeping and Emergency Stop Function are not functioning. I noticed a few hours after leaving the dealership. The earliest service appointment I can get is on Thursday. Has anyone else encountered this on the new Cayennes? It's not a good sign when a brand new vehicle already needs service. Maybe I should have kept my Macan GTS (zero issues).  ![Emergency Stop Unavailable](https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_2723_2fd30bcf5a4c4895ff168673f87b8f12cce9212e.jpg) _Emergency Stop Unavailable_ ![ALK Not Available](https://cimg4.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_2722_5f5083ca6b4927a7be2badced42a8020af0c9040.jpg) _ALK Not Available_

Does turning off the engine and restarting remove the error? I one time had some sort of camera error that caused warning messages across several functions including emergency stopping. Turned the car off for a few minutes. When I restarted everything cleared and hasn’t returned. The dealer ran a check but no codes found.

It won’t go away. It shows up each time I start the car and those features do not work. I’m at 180 mi now.

3 weeks new and mine had a total meltdown today. Every system had an error message.

Thomas has a good suggestion. It could be a problem with a flat battery. Cars are sometimes parked at dealerships for a long time, then during the preparation of the car for delivery to the customer and demonstration, many electrical consumers are switched on. I would start by charging the battery well with a charger.

Cars are sometimes parked at dealerships for a long time, then during the preparation of the car for delivery to the customer and demonstration, many electrical consumers are switched on. I would start by charging the battery well with a charger.
The selling dealership suggested this could be a problem (low voltage), but they thought it would be fine the next morning since I did a 100 mile drive and the battery should have recharged on its own. I don't have a battery charger to try this out.

there are a few people like:
  * antigravity SC-10 or SC-4
  * CTEK makes several that work, but the antigravity ones have displays
  * Porsche also makes a couple

I have a NOCO 15000 smart charger, but I don't want to hook it up just yet. I'll let the dealer diagnose first and if it needs a battery they can replace. then I'll start using it. I shouldn't have to honestly....I didn't buy an electric vehicle. Reminds me of one of the reasons I left BMW for the constant low battery warning.

[@denaliman](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/248743-denaliman.html>) that's a fine path, if you get a curious tech. i believe the process they should follow would take longer then they'll be willing to spend. For others who may be curious, this is my process for my 92Ah AGM battery, i plan to do a long post once i am finished and report out w data points over time.
  1. charge the battery slow until it's charged. mine took 3 hours w a 5 amp charger.
  2. then you wait 6 hours or over night and check the voltage without waking the car up, this means leaving hood ajar. that gives you an initial reading.
  3. then you can just measure every 24 hours for a few days until it stabilizes - leaving hood ajar every evening, drive as normal during the day on the days you drive.
  4. If it just slowly keeps dropping by say 0.02-0.03mV a day and settles just above or below 12.5V, then you need to test for parasitic draw. normal for these cars is 50-75mA, ideally a car is under 50mA, but unless you turn off a bunch of things in this class of vehicle, you probably won't be under 50mA.
  5. if parasitic draw is normal, you should load test the battery, if the battery passes the load test it means that you are not driving the car enough to keep the battery charged given the level of parasitic draw, and you need a battery tender.
  6. in theory, something could be wrong with the alternator or BMS, but there are issues w these, you'd see error messages

I believe the BMS is working as designed, and due to the fuel economy goals, the battery can be taxed depending on driving habits, so the comprise is to use a battery tender.
