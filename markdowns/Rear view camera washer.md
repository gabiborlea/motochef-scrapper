Maybe I’m the only person in the world that didn’t realise but just in case wanted to share that I discovered tonight that when you wash the rear window it also sprays the rear view camera. Seriously cool feature

Didn’t know that! It’d be very helpful as on wet days the rearview camera becomes useless easily. Thanks for sharing

Only thing missing is a mini wiper for the camera!

The cover would blow off every time you went through a car wash.

Who knew? Thanks for posting - really good to know. I can't tell you how many times my car's rearview camera was dirty and so I got out of the car to clean it manually.

![Default](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/icons/icon1.gif) **Soap is sprayed on backup camera**
I have a 2022 Panamera 4S e-hybrid Sport Turismo and I see a trail of soap that comes from the camera’s cleaner nozzle (down the front of the license plate onto the paint below the plate). I can’t remember the last timeI used the rear window wiper (which triggers the soap spray) and I wonder if the nozzle is leaking. Has anyone else seen this. Maybe it’s designed to remind me to wash the car more often.

I have a 2022 Panamera 4S e-hybrid Sport Turismo and I see a trail of soap that comes from the camera’s cleaner nozzle (down the front of the license plate onto the paint below the plate). I can’t remember the last timeI used the rear window wiper (which triggers the soap spray) and I wonder if the nozzle is leaking. Has anyone else seen this. Maybe it’s designed to remind me to wash the car more often.
I’ll assume your spray nozzle is the same or similar to the Cayenne’s. The spray nozzle has an integrated check valve which has failed and is allowing leakage, which causes the staining. Also occurs in the VW Touareg. For the Cayenne, the “Injection Nozzle with Valve” is Part # PAB-955-993-A (Rear Camera) or PAB-955-993 (Rear Surround Camera). Part depends on if you have Surround View option. See attached exploded parts diagram (#6) with picture overlay for orientation.

Maybe I’m the only person in the world that didn’t realise but just in case wanted to share that I discovered tonight that when you wash the rear window it also sprays the rear view camera. Seriously cool feature
How do you turn on rear cam washer on **_a coupe_** without rear wipers? I don't even see an icon to turn on the cleaner on the screen. Thanks

2023 base and I do not have the wash Camera only option. It does wash the camera when I wash the rear window.

If you wash the read window and then back up the camera is suddenly pretty useless for a bit.
