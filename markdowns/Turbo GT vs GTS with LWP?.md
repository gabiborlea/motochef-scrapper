Can someone explain to me the difference? They have the same engine…and when you add the LWP to the GTS it’s the same exhaust and dimensions. So how come the turbo gt performs so much better? is the turbo gt worth the extra $50k retail? thanks!!!!

The GTS is a great option and with sport cats would sound like a beast. Turbo GT is the ludacris version. I can’t explain the torque and power, it’s just madness and IMO worth every cent.

It also really comes down to which version you want? Coupe vs suv.

Tuning. Makes milestones of differences in every aspect. GTS is amazing though and mere mortals can purchase them.

Not the same engine. It may start as a similar engine, but the TGT engine is worked over by the motorsports division. Yes, you can tune a GTS for more power, but the same is true for a TGT and considering the upgrades made to the TGT, I'd venture to guess that it can safely handle more power than a GTS.

This. The TGT shares the same block as the regular GTS/turbo but thats about it. The crankshaft, con-rods, pistons, injection system, turbos, timing chain etc are all reworked along with the cooling and 4WD system which also has extra cooling.

actually, the turbos have the same part number.  ![](https://cimg6.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/920x2000/img_0488_cc044dc3e74f259ede2186c95cfa4ddbd4c2d1c4.png) ![](https://cimg7.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/920x2000/img_0489_6347139aa0ed704429c6d36ad2d69d56e28b307a.png) according to this. All the cayenne v8 turbos are using the same turbo.

actually, the turbos have the same part number according to this. All the cayenne v8 turbos are using the same turbo.
I stand corrected ![](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif) Porsche's press release was a little ambiguous. Note this is for the previous version. The release for the latest version doesn't cover as much detail on the engine. [https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021...-gt-24947.html](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/products/porsche-cayenne-turbo-gt-24947.html>) "The Cayenne Turbo GT’s biturbo engine is currently Porsche’s most powerful eight-cylinder unit. The most extensive upgrades were carried out in the areas of the crankshaft drive, turbocharger, direct fuel injection, induction system and intercooler. The V8 of the Turbo GT differs from that of the Turbo Coupé in fundamental elements such as its crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, timing chain drive and torsional vibration dampers. Given the increase in power to 471 kW (640 PS), these components have been designed for higher peak loads and improved driving dynamics. The faster-shifting eight-speed Tiptronic S and the Porsche Traction Management (PTM) system have also been modified. There is also additional water cooling for the transfer case. The standard sports exhaust system, with its central tailpipes, is unique to the Cayenne Turbo GT. From the middle of the vehicle, the exhaust system, including the rear silencer, is made from lightweight and particularly heat-resistant titanium. An additional weight saving is achieved through the omission of the centre silencer" And on the suspension: "Compared to the Cayenne Turbo Coupé, the Turbo GT rides up to 17 millimetres lower. Based on this, both the passive chassis components and active control systems have been re-engineered and optimised for handling and performance. They also feature specific calibration to guarantee perfect interaction between them. As an example, the rigidity of the three-chamber air suspension has been increased by up to 15 per cent, and the damper characteristics of the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) as well as the application of the Power Steering Plus and rear-axle steering have also been adapted.

I find it more interesting to see how the motor itself is different from the Turbo (non GT) vs GTS.

I think they're identical apart from the software at least for the 9Y0.1 i.e. pre facelift If you look at the Techart stage 1 kits, they both make 640PS up from 460PS for the GTS and 550PS for the Turbo.

GTS, Turbo and Turbo GT are 3 different cars. There are many significant differences in the engine hardware, its software, transmission software and suspension. Paradoxically, GTS and Turbo GT are the most similar because the differences between them are limited mainly to the engine. The suspension and transmission software in these 2 models are almost identical.
