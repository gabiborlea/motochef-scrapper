Has Porsche realized that their marketing and sales strategy is headed in the wrong direction? Or maybe they noticed that their cost-cutting policy is difficult for customers to accept?

interesting. if it were due to cost cutting rubbing customers the wrong way, i suppose time would tell if we see some of these cost cuts reversed.

The fact that Porsche appears to have jumped into the EV market much too aggressively might also be a factor as evidenced by the number sitting on dealer lots.

They have been steadily heading in the wrong direction from a product marketing strategy for the last 5 yrs. Missing the mark on who their customer is and could be and what they want. Getting all enamored with form (and features) over function, resulting in fiddly UI/controls, too many sw issues, missing KISS principle. If I wanted to drive around staring at a laptop, I would have bought a Tesla. EV...no thanks.

I'll start:
  * redesign sun visors
  * key fobs with tailgate lift that requires a longer or 2x push to open; also have them close via fob
  * redesign start/stop push button. It looks down market

Porsche is not meeting its sales and profit targets. China sales dropped significantly. As with other manufacturers, Porsche jumped into the EV market too aggressively and it's hurting their total profits. Porsche has missed several marks on design and technical issues, latest being the center lock design debacle. I, for one, am tired of Porsche dealerships' ADM games and took my money somewhere else. The economy has been softening for some time and future consumer spending is questionable. This is all just speculation on my part and so, what do I know?!

Conjecture based on a career of seeing ousters up close and personal: - Finance and IT guy: too much invested in EV development and in-vehicle data services not generating profits. - Sales and Marketing guy: too much emphasis on EVs, examples are Taycan and Macan EV sales and redirection of K1 platform development toward hybrid and ICE, previously all-EV.

I'll start:
  * redesign sun visors
  * key fobs with tailgate lift that requires a longer or 2x push to open; also have them close via fob
  * redesign start/stop push button. It looks down market


let's add:
  * the stupid head light single button control that you have to multi click over and over to manually set your lights
  * a simple scroller to adjust the interior lighting instead of having to navigate thru 4 levels of menu

New car prices too high. Option prices too high. People will move to other brands when prices get this crazy. At the same time, Porsche has reduced quality. New interior designs seem like a step backwards. In addition, reliability seems to be headed in the wrong direction as evidenced by LiFePo battery issues and water pump design problems, neither of which appears well thought out or properly tested.

Porsche addressed the LiFePO4 battery issue during the 2022 model year. So consider that a reliability course correction by Porsche. The water pump concern appears to still be an ongoing issue. Agreed that pricing has gotten out of control - but that's not just with Porsche, it's across the board with all manufacturers.

Porsche had seen the ADM's people were chasing and decided that was going to work on all products and / or thought that the COVID bubble pricing was gonna last forever. Predictably it hasn't. Even vaunted, limited cars like the 718 spyder are becoming more and more prevalent. Used cars are sitting as are new cars. Porsche chased this with their pricing (look at the new GT3!) and they have hit the wall. Especially since 1. They simultaneously cheapened the product and 2. Value / availability of options is stronger than ever.

Porsche will never reduce prices. Someone can always pay. Price increases may slow. Or not. Porsche is targeting the x%ile income or net worth customer. Income and net worth always increase over time in aggregate. So will Porsche prices. Anyone who laments bring priced out of the Porsche market has an income or net worth that has not kept pace with Porsche pricing.

With any auto manufacturer, economy of scale drives the need to produce at volume. I'm sure when Porsche goes through the budgeting and financial forecasting, they don't generally forecast flat sales or sales decline. Growth is expected by investors. Porsche's "problem cars" in their lineup - Taycan, Panamera, weigh down the profitability of the company. They depend on the volume leaders (Macan, Cayenne) to drive their business. So Porsche has to be concerned about sales volume - and particularly with the Macan and Cayenne. Perhaps they will not "lower" prices, but an effective strategy would be to adjust / increase the standard equipment to include some of the more requested extra cost options. That will improve their production efficiency and help substantiate higher value to potential purchasers.

The GT3 is indeed a special car and the .2 is an improvement but is it "improvement enough" to pay over $300k with ADM for what is basically a novelty? The NA 4.0 is a great engine but it has had its day. It's funny to watch people fall over each other to buy one. Pay a little more and you can jump over to the exotics. Just my 2 cents.
