I moved my deposit from my 24 S to a 25 GTS. Dealer says we won’t be able to order the GTS until the cayenne MY change over happens because they will be 25 only Anyone have experience on when the MY changeover for cayennes will happen?

Good move, I think they would be the normal Jul/Aug timeframe when Europe shuts down for a few weeks, not sure the exact dates. 25's will start building sometime in Aug? First deliveries will be late this year if things work as normal.

I talked to my dealer and was told I would be first in line for a GTS allocation when they are released. For what it's worth, my understanding from the conversation is that allocations will start being issued, and the US configurator should go live, roughly within the next month. That first builds would lock in August, and deliveries this fall. My current questions about the car: Is the 10mm height difference from the standard Cayenne models 10mm in all height settings? Previous GTS was quoted to be 20mm lower, but TGT 17mm lower. So just confused about the actual difference in ride height. I doubt it but am hoping that it is the same as the TGT. Does anyone know if the 8 way sport seat can go as low and have as much rake as the 18-ways? I want to be able to get the seat as low as possible. I know in the 992, the 18 ways can go lower than 4 way so I am wondering if that is the case here.

..... Does anyone know if the 8 way sport seat can go as low and have as much rake as the 18-ways? I want to be able to get the seat as low as possible. I know in the 992, the 18 ways can go lower than 4 way so I am wondering if that is the case here.
You need to go to a dealer and physically check out the 18-way sport seat vs the regular front seat, to see if it is what you want. The 18-way one has side edge bolsters on the seat back and also on the seat itself where your bum sits on. These thick seat edge bolsters make the front seat higher than the regular seat. As a result, you need to raise yourself up above the seat edge bolster in order to get into a 18-way front seat, rather than just slide your bum across into a regular front seat.

Can't answer definatively but: 1 - Std normal height on Coupe is 7.5in, max of 9.3in. TGT is 6.8/8.7in so looks like overall drop will be throughout the range, need website to update but 10mm suggests GTS will be 7.1/8.9in heights, not quite as low as the TGT 2 - l would assume so as they are the same seat, just less power features on the 8 way, based on the count I beleive the 8 would have front and rear up/down allowing for rake, but it doesn't state that. Would probably need to try and find one at a dealer to confirm. That said, I know you would lose the comfort access with the 8 way, even if I didn't need the bolster adj. that alone makes it worth it, plus I think you also lose steering power adj, which would impact overally effectiveness of memory settings too if you have multiple drivers.

Good info, thanks for all the ride height info! Looks like I'll be going for the 18 ways. Not having comfort access can be a bit annoying and I do really like the adjustment of the 18 ways in the cayenne my wife drives.

No idea, I assume soon, maybe next week. It exists in other markets so can't be long now.

I know - I was set in CR but now will have to go with Blue. I’m sure if we all complain enough they’ll offer body color moldings for another $1k.

I'm guessing you can replace the black with a different option/package (for a $'s I'm sure) to get painted similar to the options on the S.

According to worldwide configurator you can spec the exterior colored sport design to eliminate the gloss black. I personally think the gloss black looks good and helps the car stand out as a GTS. The exterior color bits make it look like a regular Cayenne with Sport Design pkg.

Be interesting to see how the Gloss Black works, would be exclusive to this model as the GT is Matt Black and the Sports Design doesn't have as much black on the S. I think it will be color dependant but there will be an option to remove it, although I will try and leverage the deisgn and thinking Arctic Grey will be the route to go. Biggest issue is if you go off piste on the spec and try to convert the inside to leather and remove the black trim the price probably racks up more than necessary, we shall see. I Just compared the spec sheet to the S config and my estimate is the S spec's to GTS level would come in at $130,440 vs $131,495 for the GTS, about right given the latter is 2025 pricing, plus you get the HP bump and the suspension/mapping upgrades for essentially free as you can't spec those on the S, so all checks out. Figuring between another $20-35k in additional options depending on how the colors and interior choices pan out. Throw in a Burmester and PCCB's and you can easily get this thing over $180k 😱

Good info, thanks for all the ride height info! Looks like I'll be going for the 18 ways. Not having comfort access can be a bit annoying and I do really like the adjustment of the 18 ways in the cayenne my wife drives.
14 ways are a good compromise. If your GTS will be a DD, the 18's can be a pain getting in/out.
