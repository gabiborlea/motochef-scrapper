![Default](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/icons/icon1.gif) **Bose Stereo in 2021 GTS Coupe**
I am looking to replace the Bose system and having trouble finding information about the locations and types of speakers for the Bose system. For my Macan, I was able to find a chart that showed the locations of the speakers and amp. But can’t find anything for the Cayenne. Any help?

The best I can do is provide Porsche’s description of the system and the speaker location info for the SUV. The Coupé might have similar speaker placement, at least up front. BOSE® Surround Sound System The BOSE® Surround Sound System is available as an optional extra in the Porsche Cayenne. It has a total of 14 loudspeakers with a total output of 710 watts as well as a digital amplifier and a passive subwoofer. The BOSE® Centerpoint® technology allows playback of stereo sources in surround mode and thus produces a much better stereophonic sound compared with playback in stereo. With AudioPilot® noise compensation technology, you can enjoy the sound of the BOSE® Surround Sound System irrespective of vehicle speed and engine speed. Driving noises are recorded by a microphone, detected in real time and compensated by means of a frequency-dependent volume correction system. The Bose SoundTrue® enhancement technology counteracts the problem of music compression. As a result, parts of high-loss music tracks can be restored in the high-frequency range, thereby improving the sound.  ![](https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1471/img_6581_71c047e8e94d33f1ab776c68d064a738529eda45.jpeg)

yes i have the bose system and i am not thrilled with it. i turned off all the magical processing and felt that helped. i still feel there is something not correct w the frequency response. (and they seem to weight more than they should into the front center speaker) my first step is to get my mic into the car, and figure the frequency response, then hopefully correct it by applying an eq curve in spotify.

There's something audiophiles know. The speakers of any audio system require a certain break-in period. After several dozen hours of playing, the sound quality improves. This was also the case with the B&O Advanced system in my SQ8. Believe it or not, it is true. If there are real audiophiles on this forum, they will confirm this.

No car audio system will be as good as a home audio system. Even the most expensive one. Just not the same speakers, not the same acoustics of the car interior and not the same resonance chambers.

Audiophile is a dirty word that ought to be banned (on this site). Any one can self identify as an audiophile even if they are still in diapers. <quote>hopefully correct it by applying an eq curve in spotify.</quote> This.

Audiophile is a dirty word that ought to be banned (on this site). Any one can self identify as an audiophile even if they are still in diapers. <quote>hopefully correct it by applying an eq curve in spotify.</quote> This.

I had a hobby-business restoring vintage audio for about 10 years, and kept a few items, even though I don't restore amps, tuners, cassette decks, speakers, and turntables anymore. Pictures are of Pioneer HPM1100s (1980) driven by Sansui G8000 (1977). The CD player is a Sony Super Audio CD player. We have Bose systems in all three Porsches (9Y0, 971, 997). We also have a pair of Bose 901 Series IIs with the Bose equalizer connected to a Pioneer SX-1050 in the living room. They are crisp, power hogs, and not ported.  ![](https://cimg6.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/20220715_200422_14d9d99ef826683c0a1ac78f1a56456934491300.jpg) ![](https://cimg7.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/20220715_200443_318f41e86b0caa5be29f9ffd1f00befc20cd6e34.jpg)

[@Vapordan](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/284764-vapordan.html>) on my end, i have an eq curve i like. i was thinking if i can take measurements to see what eq curve the car has i can create a new curve that will get the car close to my preferred. but as @retom suggests, waiting on that makes sense. and i have enough to do already.
