![Default](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/icons/icon1.gif) **Cayenne purchase with looming tariffs**
With new tariffs looming for European imports, how to time a purchase of a new Cayenne or any Porsche? I’m assuming tariffs are charged on goods at time of clearing customs? My question is, can the dealer add the cost of new tariffs to an order after signing but before the car is delivered, should the timing of the tariffs be such?

At this point it may be too early to speculate as to the potential impact, and degree of impact of tariffs on the pricing of a new Porsche. With tariffs supposedly going into effect on Monday for Canada, Mexico, and China, we should be able to get some idea on how that may affect some automakers - Audi for example as they build virtually all of their best selling model (Q5) in Mexico. Over the past few months I solidified the decision to purchase a new Cayenne - but not the exact timing. However - after considering the price increase of the 2025 over the 2024, and in consideration of possible impacts of any tariffs on Porsche, I locked in the purchase of a new 2024 yesterday. The timing to me seemed good.

I’m in a similar decision and timing situation, maybe a bit behind since I was thinking of order when MY 2026 opens up. I have done that for all my new cars, getting an extra model year does matter in some ways. However if I’m facing $10k+ price increases due to tariffs on a $115k purchase I definitely will make sure I get the order in for a 2025 to avoid it, if even possible.

I think you'll need to buy a vehicle that is currently sitting on a lot to be assured you'll avoid the cost of tariffs if in fact the US government puts them in place against Europe. A 10% tariff on a $115,000 vehicle could be as much as $10,000 - no dealer is going to eat that (in my opinion). On a move forward, I wonder how many car buyers will switch from Cayenne to an American built Cadillac to avoid the tariffs?

[@Solstice](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/132120-solstice.html>) can you post any links to your tariff materials or news articles you found? I have found it quite hard to ascertain what the tariff amount is for a given item the past when i've looked. it appears to be an amount not line listed as a line item for a customer. Sales tax is listed separate for example. Tariff isn't. it is baked it. so you don't know what the added cost is coming from in many case, just that the price went up. I would like it to be clear. It would be nice if consumers could answer this question easily: Is a cost increase on an item due to the manufacture, or due to a tariff? i found this saying 25%: [https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/reso...ve-powerhouse/](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/www.oxfordeconomics.com/resource/driving-into-uncertainty-how-trumps-tariffs-could-derail-europes-automotive-powerhouse/>)

The current plan may impact domestic autos more than German brands. Many of the parts that go into a General Motors product are imported from our neighboring countries.

it is a mess. vehicle excise tax in my area is 10.5%. you can escape it by registering a vehicle elsewhere, which isn't easy and isn't an option available for everyone. if there is a tariff it is everywhere in the US. so, does that mean the vehicle excise tax will go away, essentially making it a swap? i thought the argument was to reduce tax, and increase tariffs. frankly, if i am paying about the same, i prefer everything be tariff based, because that way you are penalizing items made elsewhere, where as many times, i will hunt and hunt for items made domestically, or at least by another first world country. certain countries, i avoid and really i don't like to buy from. i paid 100$ for US made nail clippers. they were the only option i could find made in the U.S. made by a medical supplier in Brooklyn - that is sad state of affairs that something as simple as nail clippers are generally not produce in country.

Probably one of the reasons inventories jumped at the end of the year. Slowing sales and supply problems resolved are the other reasons. While having the Cayenne cleaned up from the trip to Florida I wondered into a Mercedes and Audi dealerships. New cars all over the place. There were even 6 RS6 Avants at the Audi dealer. The last I looked the Porsche dealer had over 180 new vehicles. There was a big push to get vehicles to the dealers.

Greedy dealers will drop discounts and/or raise prices once the tariffs are in place. Already expensive car will be more expensive, but the rich will be getting richer so Porsche will be OK.

yeah i can see dealer raising prices for all cayennes once the tariff goes in. why would they not. they were lightening quick to add ADM during other manufacturing shortages. a dealer would have two cars, almost identical, one costing 25% more. why not just take away market anxiety, and just charge 25% more for both. sure you may move product a bit slower, but you make an extra 25% on existing stock. they'll sell.

This is one of those things that is out of our control and above our pay grade. No reason to worry about it when it’s not in our control. Just go out and buy your cayenne and enjoy it.

If prices did go up by 25%, I would keep my current car longer or look at different cars that are not tariffed. Not sure what those cars would be, but I’d rather not pay another 25% on top of an already premium priced car.

That's the beauty of it. The price of all cars will go up because there are no cars that are solely manufactured in the USA using only made in USA parts.

I have not seen the details yet. Would not surprise me if there are exceptions for Euro/Asian cars assembled in factories in the US. Or exceptions based on the percentage of imported parts. I guess we will know soon enough.
