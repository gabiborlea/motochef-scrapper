Question for you, '25 GTS Coupe 2 weeks old. Came out this morning and noticed the rear end on passenger side slightly lower than drivers side. Started car and adjusted ride height a few times then back to normal. It is still lower on the passenger side. Does the vehicle self level once you drive away? Have not noticed this before today. I measured both side gaps in the wheel wells and the passenger side is 3/4" lower than driver side. I hope it's not a leaking airbag. This seems abnormal to me, but this is my first Cayenne. Before I call the dealer wanted to see if this is normal and will self adjust.

Abnormal. Ride height should be "nominal" and stable/steady/static at all times when the vehicle is not moving. Any other condition is abnormal.

agree w [@chassis](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/233213-chassis.html>) this is a post i did in another related thread you might check that thread out: [https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-...l#post19879244](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/1455145-2023-cayenne-turbo-extreme-cold-behavior-air-suspension-and-pscb-2.html#post19879244>) Your case w just one side is different, but i'd note the conditions such as the temp, and take pics w a measuring tape showing the issue so you have a rebuttal if they say they can't replicate it.

Had ours couple months and 3000 miles. Many days sub freezing locally and a trip up north. Never seen a side sag…always level.

Update: Car has been sitting in garage all day. i just opened the door and the compressor kicked in and levelled both sides. Still do not think this is normal. I'll will wait and see in the morning if it is still level. I did take pictures prior to opening the door and sent them to the dealer.

Mine sags in the rear on cold days -25C and colder, but the sag is equal on both sides. It has done it since new.

I had that issue in a Lexus. They threw sensors and other hardware at it. Never fixed it. Once out of warranty, they told me that the right airbags had pinhole leaks. They refused to pay for it, so I converted the car to struts and springs. I wish I had done that before....finally had road feel and decent handling compared to what I had before. I'd ask them to check for leaks, whcih might be why the compressor is running when you open the door.

there should be no noticeable sag. this is not intentional. if it is happening because it is cold, it still isn’t by design. otherwise, we see a bunch of sagging porsches on dealer lots. this would not sell cars.

Update: Car has been sitting in garage all day. i just opened the door and the compressor kicked in and levelled both sides. Still do not think this is normal. I'll will wait and see in the morning if it is still level. I did take pictures prior to opening the door and sent them to the dealer.
UPDATE 2: Car had a total meltdown today. Every system failure lit up on the screen, All wheel drive system fault, assistance system malfunction, Abs system failure, Parking system restricted, Chassis error, Rear axle steering error and an engine light that won't go off. Scheduled service with dealer....![](https://rennlist.com/forums/images/smilies/frown.gif)

This has low battery written all over it...imo. If your car is new, they sit a lot between when they are built and when they get delivered. With their normal level of parasitic drain being between 50-70mA due to all the systems and convenience features, you can end up with a low battery. If I would have know what I know now, I would have charged my battery up first thing, and immediately started using a battery maintainer if you don't drive a lot, or do short drives.

Everything seemed fine this morning. I drove 150kms parked and then came out 30 min later and this happened. Battery should have been charged I would think after driving for over an hour straight. A few short trips on the weekend and there was nothing.

i have noticed, the alternator doesn’t always output. even in sport mode. there seems to be some kind of BMS - battery management system. when the battery gets low enough, then you will see ur alternator run. ur volt meter on ur dash will then be around 15 volts. most of the time it is in some kind of trickle mode, putting out in the upper 12v range. according to my research, even if u do a long drive, if the BMS hasn’t told the alternator to charge, your battery can still trend down voltage wise and not be able to fully recover. i think this is why we see so many people w porsches use a battery maintainer.

That ridiculous if this is the case. Sounds like an engineering flaw.

A BMS, across makes these days, is pretty standard for fuel economy reasons. An alternator always running reduces fuel mileage. All manufacturers are struggling with ways to comply w/ increasingly stringent CAFE standards. That is why battery maintainers are a good idea on all modern cars with so much tech on board and software controlling things. It's far from just a Porsche issue. I've been reading the same issues on multiple car forums for nearly a decade now. For example, it's been a big issue on the last 2 Corvette generations.

i am not an expert, just sharing what i have noticed since 3 weeks ago when i got in my car and it told me to go for a long drive because the battery was low. i did not. instead i measured the voltage everyday driving just a little here and there. after 7 days i started my car and got hit with all those errors. when voltage drops too low you can see all kinds of errors.
