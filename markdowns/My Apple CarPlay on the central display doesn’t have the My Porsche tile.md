Hi everyone, First post here, long-time lurker finally joining the conversation! I've been browsing this forum for a while and it’s been incredibly helpful in figuring out various things with my 2024 Porsche Cayenne 3.0T, which I bought off of a dealer lot in November 2024. Thank you to everyone for all the great insights! I’m having an issue with Apple CarPlay in my Porsche Cayenne. The “My Porsche” tile within the Porsche menu is missing from the central display, and on the My Porsche App on my iPhone, I only have 3 Spaces available and am missing few such as “Essential - Variation,” “Quick Action,” “Quick Action - Variation,” etc. Has anyone else encountered this issue, or does anyone have suggestions for fixing it? I’ve checked settings and tried restarting the system, but no luck so far. I’m running the latest iOS version (this issue was happening even before I updated), and the Porsche software is up-to-date according to the PCM. I’ve attached a PDF with pictures showing the issue. It would also be very helpful if you could share pictures of your Apple CarPlay screen with the My Porsche tile and iPhone Spaces (similar to the ones in the attached PDF). Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

i can connect tomorrow and see what i see. i set up the extended carplay features about a year ago and they all worked then i kind of quit using carplay because the media drops quite a bit in urban environments, and i don’t care enough to use wired carplay.

Thank you @ThomasWShea. ….I see that the 5th screen that you have is missing from my infotainment. Can you share screenshots of your phone app also, please?

Porsche refers to it as "Integrated Apple Car Play" - or Apple Car Play Plus. In the YouTube video below at about the 17:45 point in it, there is information on it and how to initiate it in a 2024 Cayenne.

Thanks for looking into this further, [ThomasWShea](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/309893-thomaswshea.html>) . When I go to _Controls_ , I can see the content you shared, but it is not the fifth screen by itself—more on this later in my post. Thanks for sharing the YouTube video by Paul Steinbruner, [Ironman88](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/233896-ironman88.html>) . I’ve subscribed to Paul’s videos on YouTube, and after watching this one itself, I had realized I’m missing a few options on both my Cayenne’s infotainment screen and the iPhone app. I followed Paul’s instructions at **17:45** to set up my iPhone to use **Integrated Apple CarPlay**. However, at **22:22** , I noticed that my iPhone app doesn’t have the five options Paul shows. Instead, it looks identical to what  [ThomasWShea](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/309893-thomaswshea.html>) shared. ![](https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/920x2000/img_0991_79df7867f4a640c34f1f55c7311de4da370f6854.png) Additionally, I’m missing the screen shown in Paul’s video at **21:45**. I can access it by going to _Controls_ , but I can’t swipe right to reach it. Also, I don’t have the **"Your Cayenne"** tile Paul mentions at **23:02** , which should display the car’s configuration, color, wheels, options, etc. In Paul’s video, his _My Cayenne_ tile isn’t loading, but below is a screenshot I found from the **Porsche Newsroom (October 2023)** , which matches what Paul is referring to: 🔗 [Porsche Newsroom - My Porsche App & Apple CarPlay](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/newsroom.porsche.com/en/2023/products/porsche-my-porsche-app-provides-new-features-within-apple-carplay-33034.html>) ![](https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1748x1468/screenshot_2025_02_09_at_11_15_53_pm_2ce97064c2ae5cbed197a62af66fab851de7dae7.png) @[ThomasWShea](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/309893-thomaswshea.html>) @[Ironman88](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/233896-ironman88.html>) What model/year is your Cayenne? Do you see the "_Your Cayenne"_ tile on your infotainment screen and the other features shown in Paul’s video? @ [Ironman88](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/233896-ironman88.html>) - Does your iPhone App look like ours or as Paul shows at 22:22? Would it be possible for you to share screen pictures of your Cayenne's infotainment and your iPhone App?

[@MSCA](https://rennlist.com/forums/cayenne-9y0-2019/<https:/rennlist.com/forums/members/339670-msca.html>) 2024, coupe. i took a brief peek i will watch the full video tomorrow. BUT, the screens in his video for the extended car play are old. that is what it used to look like. i don’t have old pics. i searched. now i assume they updated the extended carplay. i didn’t use carplay for a long time, like 9 months at least. during that time the newest iOS has come out, plus several other updates. the porsche app has had several updates too. since the controls screen i see now seems more consolidated, i think it is just planned changes. i will look for the my cayenne tile. in my first screenshot, if i hit hide suggestions, that is my car under the suggestions. right wheels, right black painted door handles, exact.
